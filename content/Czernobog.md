### 1. Grand Hall (Velika Dvorana)

A vast, echoing chamber with high, vaulted ceilings and massive chandeliers. The walls are lined with faded tapestries depicting scenes of battle and folklore. A long, heavy wooden table dominates the centre, where Lord Sergei Dmitri Petrovich holds court.

- **Challenge:** As the adventurers enter the Grand Hall, the massive chandeliers above begin to sway ominously. The doors slam shut, and shadowy figures emerge from the walls—spectral warriors bound to defend the hall. The adventurers must either defeat the spectres in combat or solve the riddle they pose: "What feeds all, yet is never sated?" (Answer: **Death**).
- **Clue:** Upon defeating the spectres or answering the riddle, a hidden compartment in the floor opens, revealing a **tarnished silver key** inscribed with the symbol of the Frozen Bride. This key opens a secret passage in another part of the castle.

### 2. Throne Room (Svetilište Moći)

A dark and imposing room where Sergei’s black iron throne sits upon a raised dais. The room is adorned with gothic statues, flickering candelabras, and stained glass windows that depict ominous scenes. This is where Sergei receives visitors and pronounces his judgments.

- **Challenge:** The throne itself is cursed, and anyone who attempts to sit on it is immediately assaulted by visions of madness and despair. The room is filled with an oppressive aura that weakens those who linger too long. To pass, the adventurers must find and destroy the **hidden sigil** beneath the throne, which is the source of the curse.
- **Clue:** Once the sigil is destroyed, the adventurers find a **hidden lever** under the throne that opens a concealed door leading to a forgotten wing of the castle, where they can find more clues about Yelena’s fate.

### 3. Banquet Hall (Sala za Gozbu)

A dimly lit room with a long table set for feasts, though it now serves more as a place for Sergei to entertain his guests (and victims). The hall is filled with heavy furniture, richly carved from dark wood, and a massive fireplace that casts eerie shadows across the walls.

- **Challenge:** The food on the table in the Banquet Hall is cursed—anyone who eats it is slowly turned into a mindless thrall of Sergei. The adventurers must resist the temptation to eat and instead locate the **source of the curse**: a corrupted chalice on the head table. Destroying the chalice lifts the curse.
- **Clue:** Hidden within the chalice is a **folded piece of parchment** detailing the final feast held in the hall before Yelena’s freezing, with cryptic references to a "ritual of ice" performed beneath the castle.

### 4. Chapel of Shadows (Kapela Senki)

A small, eerie chapel dedicated to Nethira, the Goddess of Deceit. The room is cold and filled with the scent of incense and burnt offerings. Dark icons and relics line the walls, and an altar stands at the front, where dark rituals are performed.

- **Challenge:** The chapel is guarded by shadowy wraiths who rise from the darkness whenever light enters the room. The adventurers must figure out that the wraiths are vulnerable to **sunlight**, which can be redirected into the room using a series of mirrors found throughout the castle.
- **Clue:** Once the wraiths are defeated, the altar opens to reveal a **stone tablet** with an inscription describing the freezing ritual in detail, including the involvement of Nethira and the deception that led to Yelena’s curse.

### 5. Library of Forbidden Lore (Biblioteka Zaboravljenih Tajni)

A vast, labyrinthine library filled with ancient tomes, grimoires, and scrolls, many of which are forbidden or cursed. The shelves are towering, and there’s always a feeling of being watched. The centrepiece is a large, black oak desk where Sergei studies ancient texts.

- **Challenge:** The bookshelves in the library are enchanted to rearrange themselves whenever someone reaches for a specific book. To find the book they need, the adventurers must solve a **puzzle**: rearrange the titles of several books to spell out a hidden phrase (e.g., "Knowledge is Power").
- **Clue:** The correct book, once found, contains detailed notes on the **rituals** performed in the castle, including a mention of the **Frozen Chamber** and its location deep beneath the castle.

### 6. Hall of Mirrors (Ogledalo Dvorana)

A long corridor lined with ornate, floor-to-ceiling mirrors. The reflections are often distorted, showing scenes from the past or visions of doom. This room is said to be cursed, and those who linger too long may be lost within the mirrors.

- **Challenge:** The reflections in the mirrors are twisted and dangerous—some of them can step out of the mirrors and attack the adventurers. The adventurers must determine which mirrors are safe by identifying the **incomplete reflections** (e.g., reflections missing a key feature like a scar or a piece of equipment).
- **Clue:** Behind one of the safe mirrors is a **hidden alcove** containing an old, dust-covered journal. The journal is written by one of Sergei’s former brides and details her failed attempt to reach the Frozen Bride before her demise, along with directions to the **crypt**.

### 7. Dungeon (Tamnica)

The castle’s dark and damp dungeon, where prisoners are kept in iron cells. The air is thick with the scent of decay, and the walls are slick with moisture. Chains, torture devices, and rusted manacles are scattered throughout. This is where Sergei’s enemies meet their end.

- **Challenge:** The dungeon is filled with the spirits of the tortured, who will not rest until they are avenged. The adventurers must perform a **ritual of absolution** using sacred herbs and a chant they find elsewhere in the castle to calm the spirits and allow them to pass.
- **Clue:** Once the spirits are appeased, a hidden door in the dungeon opens, revealing a **set of manacles** used on Yelena before she was taken to the Frozen Chamber. These manacles are engraved with the symbol of Nedarin, indicating divine intervention in her fate.

### 8. Crypt (Kripta)

A deep, subterranean chamber where the bodies of Sergei’s former brides and victims lie in eternal rest. The crypt is filled with coffins, each inscribed with the names of those interred. The air is cold, and there’s a constant feeling of dread. This may also be where Sergei’s own coffin is hidden.

- **Challenge:** The crypt is guarded by the **restless spirits** of Sergei’s former brides, who rise from their tombs to protect their resting place. The adventurers must either defeat them in combat or find the **sacred relic** buried within the crypt that can lay the spirits to rest.

### 9. Alchemist’s Laboratory (Alhemijina Laboratorija)

A secret, cluttered room filled with bubbling cauldrons, vials of strange liquids, and shelves lined with jars containing unknown substances. The laboratory is where Sergei’s alchemist conducts experiments, often with dark and dangerous outcomes.

- **Challenge:** The laboratory is filled with dangerous alchemical concoctions, some of which release toxic fumes when disturbed. The adventurers must carefully navigate the room, disabling traps and avoiding the fumes. They might need to create a **protective potion** using the ingredients found in the lab.
- **Clue:** On a dusty shelf, they find an **alchemical formula** for a potion that was used to keep Yelena alive during the freezing ritual, which could be crucial for reviving her.

### 10. Council Chamber (Vijećnica)

A room where Sergei meets with his advisors and other nobles. The chamber is adorned with dark wood panelling, and the chairs are high-backed and imposing. The walls are lined with maps of the region, and a large, ominous painting of the castle hangs over the fireplace.

- **Challenge:** The council chamber is enchanted with a **truth-telling spell**—anyone who speaks a lie is struck by a powerful curse. The adventurers must navigate a dialogue with a magical apparition that only responds truthfully to questions posed without deceit.
- **Clue:** In the chamber, they find a **map** of the castle with several hidden rooms marked, including the Frozen Chamber and the path through the crypt that leads to it.

### 11. Observatory (Opservatorija)

A tower room with a large, ancient telescope pointing towards the heavens. The walls are covered with star charts and celestial maps. The observatory is used not only for studying the stars but also for dark rituals that align with astrological events.

- **Challenge:** The observatory is enchanted to show visions of possible futures—some are true, others are illusions meant to deceive. The adventurers must discern which vision shows the correct path forward by using clues from other parts of the castle.
- **Clue:** One of the visions shows a **constellation** that aligns with a sigil found in the Chapel of Shadows, revealing the timing needed to perform the ritual to awaken Yelena.

### 12. Master’s Bedroom (Gospodareva Spavaća Soba)

A grand, yet darkly furnished bedroom with a massive canopy bed draped in rich, dark fabrics. The room is filled with ornate furniture, including a vanity with a mirror that never reflects the true image. This is where Sergei retreats to rest and plot.

- **Challenge:** The bedroom is guarded by an enchanted suit of armour that attacks anyone who enters. The armour can only be disabled by removing its **core gem**, hidden within a chest in the room. The adventurers must first find the hidden chest key.
- **Clue:** Inside the chest, they find a **letter** from Sergei to a past lover, describing his obsession with Yelena and his plan to keep her frozen forever. The letter includes a clue about how to break the curse.

### 13. Frozen Chamber (Zaleđena Komora)

A hidden, frigid room deep beneath the castle where the Frozen Bride, Yelena, lies in slumber. The room is coated in ice, and a cold mist hangs in the air. The walls are etched with arcane symbols, and the floor is covered in frost. This is the heart of the castle’s curse.

- **Challenge:** The Frozen Chamber is protected by powerful ice magic that can only be dispelled by a **specific incantation** found in the Chapel of Shadows. The room is filled with traps that trigger bursts of freezing wind and ice shards.
- **Clue:** Once the ice magic is dispelled, the adventurers find a **crystal vial** containing Yelena’s last breath before she was frozen, which may be needed to fully awaken her.

### 14. Secret Garden (Tajni Vrt)

A secluded, overgrown garden hidden within the castle walls. The garden is filled with dark, twisted trees and poisonous plants. A fountain stands in the centre, its water black as night. This is where Sergei meditates and communes with dark forces.

- **Challenge:** The garden is overgrown with thorny vines that come to life and attack intruders. The vines can only be subdued by using a **sacred flame** found in the Chapel of Shadows. The adventurers must find the source of the corruption in the garden and cleanse it.
- **Clue:** In the centre of the garden, they find an **ancient stone** inscribed with a prophecy about Yelena and the role she plays in the fate of the castle. The stone also hints at the existence of the Frozen Chamber.

### 15. Armoury (Oružarnica)

A large, cold room filled with ancient weapons and suits of armour. The walls are lined with swords, axes, and shields, many of which are enchanted or cursed. The armoury is heavily guarded, and only trusted individuals are allowed access.

### 16. Great Staircase (Veliko Stepenište)

An imposing, spiralling staircase that connects the castle’s many floors. The steps are worn from centuries of use, and the banisters are intricately carved with scenes of battle and conquest. The staircase is dimly lit by flickering torches, and it creaks ominously with every step.

- **Challenge:** The staircase is enchanted to become a **never-ending loop**, trapping those who ascend it. To break the loop, the adventurers must find and activate a **hidden switch** on one of the steps that resets the enchantment.
- **Clue:** The correct step is marked with a **small rune**, which matches a symbol found in the library. Activating the switch reveals a passage to a hidden room in the castle.

### 17. Wine Cellar (Vinski Podrum)

A vast, underground cellar filled with barrels of wine, some of which are centuries old. The cellar is also where Sergei keeps his most valuable and rare vintages, often laced with magical or alchemical substances.

- **Challenge:** The wine barrels are enchanted to release toxic gas when disturbed. The adventurers must either disable the trap or find a way to ventilate the room. They might also encounter a **shadowy figure** guarding a particular barrel.

### 18. Servants’ Quarters (Službeni Sobe)

A series of small, sparse rooms where the castle’s servants live. The quarters are cramped and poorly lit, with narrow beds and few personal belongings. The servants are loyal out of fear, and they rarely speak to outsiders.

- **Challenge:** The quarters are haunted by the spirits of servants who died under Sergei’s rule. The adventurers must perform a **cleansing ritual** to put the spirits to rest, using items found in the quarters.
- **Clue:** After cleansing the quarters, they discover a **hidden passage** leading to the crypt, with markings on the walls that hint at the location of the Frozen Chamber.

### 19. Guest Chambers (Gostinske Sobe)

A wing of the castle reserved for visiting nobles and dignitaries. The rooms are opulently decorated but have an underlying sense of unease. The furniture is grand, but the portraits on the walls seem to watch the guests, and the air is always just a bit too cold.

- **Challenge:** One of the guest rooms is trapped with a **sleep spell** that incapacitates anyone who enters. The adventurers must either find a way to dispel the magic or resist its effects long enough to search the room.

### 20. Hall of Ancestors (Dvorana Predaka)

A long hall lined with portraits and statues of Sergei’s ancestors. The room is filled with a palpable sense of history and foreboding. The eyes of the portraits seem to follow those who pass by, and it’s said that the spirits of the ancestors occasionally manifest to protect the castle.

### 21. Torture Chamber (Soba za Mučenje)

A hidden room in the dungeon where Sergei’s enemies are subjected to unspeakable horrors. The chamber is equipped with all manner of medieval torture devices, and the walls are stained with old blood. The screams of past victims are said to still echo in the air.

### 22. Tower of Curses (Kula Prokletstava)

A dark tower dedicated to dark rituals and curses. The walls are inscribed with malevolent symbols, and the air is thick with the scent of burning herbs and candles. This is where Sergei’s dark magic is strongest, and where he creates new curses to plague his enemies.

- **Challenge:** The tower is filled with cursed objects that emit powerful hexes if touched. The adventurers must either avoid triggering the curses or use a **protective charm** found elsewhere in the castle to navigate safely. They might also encounter cursed spirits that try to mislead them.

### 24. Darkened Archives (Mračni Arhivi)

A hidden room deep within the castle filled with ancient documents, maps, and forbidden knowledge. The shelves are covered in dust, and the air is heavy with the scent of old parchment. Many of the texts detail the castle’s dark history and the rituals performed there.

- **Challenge:** The archives are protected by a series of **warding glyphs** that trigger deadly traps when disturbed. The adventurers must decipher the glyphs’ meaning and deactivate them using the correct sequence of symbols, which they might find in the library.
- **Clue:** Within the archives, they find a **ledger** detailing the castle’s dark history, including records of Yelena’s freezing and the involvement of a deity who sought to protect her. The ledger also mentions a hidden chamber beneath the castle where Yelena lies in slumber.

### 25. The Watchtower (Stražarska Kula)

A high tower with a view over the entire valley and the surrounding forests. The tower is manned by vigilant guards, though their eyes are often hollow and their movements sluggish, as if they are under a spell. The tower is also used as a vantage point for dark rituals that require the light of the moon.

- **Challenge:** The watchtower is occupied by enchanted armoured sentinels that attack anyone who ascends the tower. The adventurers must find and activate the **control mechanism**—a hidden lever or switch—to deactivate the sentinels and reach the top.
