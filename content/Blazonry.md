### **Coat of Arms of Sergei Dmitri Petrovich**

**Blazon**:

- **Shield**: The shield is **sable (black)**, representing mystery, authority, and the hidden depths of Sergei's character. It is crossed by a **crimson diagonal stripe**, symbolizing the bloodline and the quiet, relentless power Sergei wields.
- **Charge**: At the centre of the shield is a **silver raven**, perched with wings slightly spread.
