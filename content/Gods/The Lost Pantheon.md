**The Lost** is a term forced upon a group of deities who were banished to the lower planes after [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]]. [[./The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] imposed this label upon them, seeing them as the embodiment of chaos, destruction, and evil. However, The Lost never chose to unite; they were thrust together as enemies of the established order. While some gods within this faction revel in their shared animosity toward [[./The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]], others despise their so-called allies as much as they do their enemies. 

The Lost remains fractured internally, with each member pursuing their own vision of domination, ruin, or subjugation. Some plot for power, while others are content to revel in the chaos they cause. Still, The Lost are united in one thing: their desire to break free from their imprisonment and reclaim the influence they believe is rightfully theirs.

# History  
In the Age of Gods, The Lost walked freely across the realm of Verak’eal, unchecked in their pursuit of power, destruction, and control. Gods like [[./The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]] revelled in ruination, while [[./The Lost/Wendel|Wendel]] amassed wealth at the expense of all others. Their unchecked influence warped the realm, turning it into a battlefield of divine wills. 

The gods of [[./The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] sought to restore balance, crafting the plan that would lead to [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]]. When this plan became known, The Lost were forced to work together in a desperate final assault to stop [[./The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]]. However, despite their immense strength, the combined efforts of [[./The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] deities succeeded, and The Lost were banished to the lower planes, their influence severely limited.

Once powerful and unchecked, the gods of The Lost now find themselves imprisoned, plotting their return to power. While they occasionally work together, old rivalries and conflicting goals often lead to internal strife. Some members, like [[./The Lost/Nethira|Nethira]], weave intricate schemes, while others, like [[./The Lost/Hekoda|Hekoda]] and [[./The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]], seek brute force to obliterate their enemies.

# Goals and Ideals  
Though not united by choice, The Lost share a desire to reclaim the power they once held, to bend mortals to their will, and to see the world burn for the insult of their imprisonment. Some are motivated by greed, others by wrath, and some by the simple pleasure of causing pain. 

Their shared ideals include:
- **Defiance**: Each member of The Lost seeks to break free of the containment imposed by [[./The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]], defying the boundaries set upon them.
- **Corruption**: The Lost aim to corrupt mortals, subverting the balance [[./The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] fought so hard to protect.
- **Dominion**: Whether through fear, wealth, or destruction, The Lost crave control over all that remains in Verak’eal.
- **Annihilation**: Some members, like [[./The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]] and [[./The Lost/Hekoda|Hekoda]], seek nothing short of total destruction, aiming to bring the world to its knees.

# The Shatter  
[[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] was both a defeat and a beginning for The Lost. In the final battle against [[./The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]], The Lost fought with all their might, but the cataclysmic event reshaped the planes, imprisoning the deities in distant realms. While [[./The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] see [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] as a victory, The Lost view it as an imprisonment they must escape.

For the gods of The Lost, [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] left a bitter legacy. Some see it as a betrayal by the other gods, while others see it as an opportunity, an event that created new planes of existence ripe for eventual conquest. Though they are contained in their own planes, The Lost still influence the mortal realm through whispers, dreams, and dark bargains made by their followers.

# Worship  
The followers of The Lost are as varied as the gods themselves, ranging from brutal warlords and greedy merchants to cunning assassins and twisted torturers. Many are drawn to these gods out of personal ambition, seeking power, wealth, or the opportunity to revel in cruelty. Temples to The Lost are often hidden, located in the darkest corners of the world, where their worshippers plot the downfall of the righteous.

Worship of The Lost often involves blood sacrifices, acts of cruelty, or demonstrations of personal power. Unlike the balanced ceremonies of [[./The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]], rituals dedicated to The Lost are violent and chaotic, invoking their gods' hunger for destruction and dominion. 

# Members  
The Lost is composed of gods who each have their own designs for Verak’eal, often working alone but occasionally forming uneasy alliances when their goals align. 
- **[[./The Lost/Fax|Fax]]**: Fax believes in asserting power over others by any means necessary. His desire to control and rule places him at odds with many, even within The Lost.
- **[[./The Lost/Hekoda|Hekoda]]**: Hekoda is fuelled by primal rage and the desire to crush the weak. His savage nature makes him a powerful but unpredictable ally, driven by pure anger.
- **[[./The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]]**: Namiut once stood as a counterpart to [[./The Grey/Mahatu|Mahatu]], the protector of the weak. Now, she seeks to subjugate and enslave all who stand before her, and she allies with The Lost to achieve her goals.
- **[[./The Lost/Nethira|Nethira]]**: Nethira thrives in chaos and deception. She despises [[./The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] and even some of her fellow Lost gods, but she uses them as pawns in her intricate schemes of manipulation and betrayal.
- **[[./The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]]**: Pentath seeks nothing less than the total annihilation of the world. He is driven by a pure desire to tear everything apart and usher in the so-called Epoch of Ends, and his followers believe he will be the one to end all existence.
- **[[./The Lost/Wendel|Wendel]]**: Wendel revels in amassing wealth and power, using any means to hoard riches. He sees the mortal realm as a resource to be exploited, and his greed knows no bounds.
- **[[./The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]**: Zarilith is a goddess of corruption and shadow, once an ally of [[./The Grey/Sheleth|Sheleth]] but now twisted by her desire for control. She revels in the darkness of the Underdark, bending the drow to her will.
- **[[./The Lost/Xiloth|Xiloth]]**: Xiloth takes pleasure in the suffering of others, both physical and mental. Her desire to inflict agony upon all living things makes her feared, even among her own kind.
