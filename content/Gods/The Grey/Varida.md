**Varida**, the **Stone Mother**, is the **goddess of forge and stone**. Preferring the deep underground where stone grants her power, she is the master of forging weapons and armours, crafting with unerring skill. Her story is deeply tied to the creation of the dwarves, a race born from her love of stone and metal and her desire for companionship. Varida’s teachings centre on strength through community, honour through craft, and the power that the earth provides.

# Description
Varida is often depicted as a stout and muscular figure, embodying the sturdiness of the stone she rules over. Her skin is the colour of dark granite, flecked with veins of shimmering ore, and her hair flows like molten lava, representing both the power of creation and the raw strength of the forge. She is always depicted with her signature tools, a hammer and tongs, symbolizing her mastery of the forge.

In her otherworldly realm, the **Eternal Forge**, she stands among mountains and vast caverns, filled with endless workshops, forges, and mines. Sparks constantly fly from her hammer, and molten metal flows like rivers, representing the unceasing labour and dedication to craft that defines her domain.

# Personality
Varida is a warm yet stern deity, embodying the solid and unyielding nature of the stone. She is a protector, a builder, and a mother figure not only to the dwarves but to all who find solace in the depths of the earth. She values community and craftsmanship above all, believing that true strength comes from working together for the greater good. 

Though she spends much of her time in the solitude of the deep, forging and crafting, she understands the importance of family, love, and companionship. This is reflected in her creation of the dwarves, and her deep love for **Tordas**, the first of their kind. She is proud and driven, never satisfied with complacency, always striving for perfection in her craft.

# Relationships
Varida’s most significant relationship is with her creation and eventual husband, **Tordas**, the first dwarf. Their union gave rise to the dwarven race, who continue to honour both Varida and Tordas as their divine parents. Varida cherishes the dwarves as her children, guiding them in their crafts and their communities.

Varida is a close ally of [[./Dinarul|Dinarul]], god of craft and perfection. The two share a mutual respect, often collaborating on grand projects that combine Varida’s knowledge of stone and metals with [[./Dinarul|Dinarul]]’s perfectionist attention to detail. Together, they are revered by artisans and craftsmen across Verak’eal.

She also maintains a cordial relationship with [[./Timnar|Timnar]], god of law, as both deities value order, structure, and the building blocks of civilisation. However, she disapproves of deities like [[../The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]] (god of destruction), whose chaotic forces seek to tear down what she and her followers build.

# Worshippers
Varida’s followers are most commonly found among dwarves, blacksmiths, masons, miners, and architects. In short, anyone who works with stone, metal, or craftsmanship. Her temples are often vast underground halls, filled with forges, anvils, and grand statues carved from the living rock. These temples double as workshops where her followers hone their crafts and contribute to the community by creating weapons, armour, and structures that serve the greater good.

Dwarves revere Varida as their mother and creator, and her teachings guide their values of honour, strength, and community. Her clerics and paladins often serve as protectors of dwarven strongholds, but they are also skilled artisans, known for forging some of the finest weapons and armour in the land. Varida’s festivals often coincide with the completion of major construction projects or significant milestones in the crafting cycle.

## Orders
- **The Stonewardens**: A group of paladins and clerics devoted to protecting the dwarven people and their works. They see themselves as the guardians of Varida’s creations and ensure that what is built will stand the test of time.
- **The Hammerwrights**: A guild of master blacksmiths, masons, and architects who follow Varida’s teachings in both their craft and their lives. They often take on apprentices, passing down ancient techniques and rituals that honour the Stone Mother.

## Favoured Sayings
- "From stone, we find our strength."
- "Forge not only with your hands, but with your heart."
- "A strong foundation is the key to any lasting creation."

# History
Varida spent much of her time in solitude, living deep within the earth, mastering the art of stonework and forging weapons of unparalleled strength. But her time alone led to a longing for companionship. In an act of divine craftsmanship, Varida sculpted a being from the very stone that surrounded her, strong, sturdy, and skilled in the ways of the forge. She named him **Tordas**, and through a powerful ritual, she breathed life into him, infusing the essence of the stone around her into the statue.

Tordas proved to be not only a skilled companion in the forge but also a source of love for Varida. In time, she confessed her feelings to him, and he returned her love, presenting her with a beautifully crafted armour he had forged as a gift. In return, Varida gave him her most precious possession, her anvil, symbolizing the heart of her divine power. From their union, the first dwarves were born, inheriting Varida’s strength and Tordas’ skill.

During [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], Varida fought alongside [[../The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]], using her mastery of stone and metal to forge the weapons and armour that equipped their forces. She provided stability and protection, fortifying strongholds with her divine craftsmanship and ensuring that the armies of [[../The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] were well-supplied. Her forges never cooled during the conflict, churning out artefacts of immense power to protect the planes from the destructive forces of [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]]. Her creations became legendary, with weapons of such fine quality that they were believed to be indestructible.

After [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], Varida retreated to her deep halls, continuing her work, though the dwarves now live as her legacy on the surface and in the mountains of Verak'eal.

# Tenets of Faith
Varida’s followers adhere to these core principles:
- Forge and sculpt for the good of all.
- Embrace the earth, it grants you strength and honour.
- Value those around you, for an army is stronger than a soldier.

# Prophets
- **Tordas the Firstborn**: The first dwarf, created by Varida, who became her companion, lover, and the father of the dwarven race. Tordas is revered by all dwarves, and his craftsmanship is said to be unparalleled, even by the greatest of artisans today.
- **Kadrin Stonehammer**: A legendary dwarven blacksmith who is said to have forged an entire fortress from a single mountain. Kadrin claimed to have been visited by Varida herself, guiding his hands as he worked.
