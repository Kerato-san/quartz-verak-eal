**Lindof** is the **god of war and strength**, revered by those who seek to prove themselves in combat and earn glory through bravery. Unlike gods who revel in bloodlust and chaos, Lindof values discipline, fairness, and the honourable conduct of warfare. He teaches that true strength comes not just from brute force, but from the responsible and fair use of power in service of a greater cause. To Lindof, battle is not merely a means to an end but a sacred test of courage and skill.

# Description
Lindof is often depicted as a towering warrior clad in full plate armour, with a greatsword slung across his back. His armour is adorned with intricate patterns symbolising past victories, and his muscular form is the embodiment of raw power tempered by discipline. His gaze is stern but never cruel, reflecting his belief that combat is a path to honour rather than destruction. His hair, braided in the style of ancient warriors, and his scarred face serve as testaments to the countless battles he has fought.

Lindof's presence on the battlefield is awe-inspiring. He moves with the grace of a seasoned fighter, each step deliberate, each strike measured. His voice carries the weight of command, and his very aura inspires those around him to stand firm, even in the face of overwhelming odds.

# Personality
Lindof is a god who believes that honour is the foundation of all conflict. To him, a battle without honour is a battle without meaning, and a warrior who fights without respect for their opponent is no warrior at all. He respects strength, but only when it is wielded responsibly and fairly. Cowardice, deceit, and trickery are anathema to him, and those who engage in such acts will find no favour in his eyes.

Though he is often seen as stern and unyielding, Lindof is also a god of fairness and reconciliation. Many of the gods he has clashed with in the past now count him as an ally, as he always seeks to mend relationships once honour has been restored. He believes that even in defeat, there is glory if one fights with bravery and integrity.

# Relationships
Lindof has fought numerous battles with other gods, but unlike more ruthless deities, his conflicts are guided by principles of honour and fairness. His closest ally is [[./Timnar|Timnar]] (god of law), who shares his belief in structure and justice, though [[./Timnar|Timnar]]’s rigid adherence to rules can sometimes frustrate Lindof’s more flexible sense of honour. He also respects [[./Dathin|Dathin]] (god of light), who shares his sense of duty and protection for the innocent.

Lindof holds little respect for gods like [[../The Lost/Nethira|Nethira]] (goddess of deceit) and [[../The Lost/Fax|Fax]] (god of domination), whose reliance on trickery and oppression is the very opposite of what Lindof stands for. He remains ever watchful of [[../The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]] (god of destruction), as he believes that unchecked chaos and ruin are a danger to the honourable conduct of war.

# Worshippers
Lindof’s followers are found wherever battle is fought, from the training grounds of young soldiers to the grand war councils of seasoned generals. His faithful value honour above all, and they believe that their strength is not just a weapon, but a tool to uphold justice and protect those who cannot protect themselves. Many soldiers and mercenaries pray to Lindof before battle, seeking his blessing to fight bravely and with honour.

Temples dedicated to Lindof are often structured like fortresses, with arenas for combat training and halls where great victories are commemorated. His priests often double as combat instructors, teaching the importance of discipline, strategy, and honourable conduct in battle. They guide warriors not only in how to fight, but how to live with integrity, ensuring that their strength is used for just purposes.

## Orders
- **The Honourbound**: A knightly order dedicated to preserving honour in battle. They often serve as arbiters in conflicts, ensuring that the rules of warfare are upheld and that combat remains just.
- **Blades of Valour**: A mercenary guild who follow Lindof’s tenets, accepting contracts only from those who respect honour and fairness. Though they fight for pay, they refuse to take part in underhanded schemes or unjust wars.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Honour is the shield that no blade can pierce."
- "Strength without honour is a battle already lost."
- "In every battle, seek the glory that is found in courage."

# History
Lindof has always been a god of war, and his history is filled with tales of great battles fought against other deities and mortal champions alike. He has crossed blades with many of his fellow gods, but his sense of honour and fairness has allowed him to repair most of those relationships. He believes that every fight is an opportunity to prove one’s strength, but only if fought with honour.

During the Shatter, Lindof eagerly joined the Grey in their war against the Lost. The Lost, with their deceitful and underhanded tactics, represented everything Lindof stood against. He fought with unmatched strength and honour during the Shatter, ensuring that the forces of chaos were driven back and that the world could be rebuilt on principles of fairness and strength.

After the war, Lindof returned to his realm, continuing to oversee battles fought in his name, always ensuring that his followers adhere to the principles of honourable combat.

# Tenets of Faith
Lindof’s followers live by these core commandments:
- Bravery above all. There is no glory in cowardice.
- Strength is the path to greatness, but greatness is the responsible use of strength.
- The glory of Lindof lives through your honour on the battlefield.

# Prophets
- **Serak the Unbroken**: A gladiator who earned his freedom through honourable combat. Serak’s undefeated streak in the arena is said to have been blessed by Lindof, and he now travels as a teacher of martial skill and honour.
- **Velara the Shieldmaiden**: A renowned warrior-queen who led her people in battle with unwavering courage. She was said to have communed with Lindof in her dreams, receiving guidance on how to unite her kingdom through honourable warfare.
