**Mahatu** is the **god of good dragons** and the embodiment of honour and justice. Once bound to **[[../The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]]**, the goddess of evil dragons, Mahatu now stands as a beacon of light and protection for all mortals. Legends speak of his noble heart and his desire to safeguard the world from evil, particularly the corrupt forces that [[../The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]] now commands. Mahatu is revered by those who value justice, honour, and the protection of the innocent.

# Description
Mahatu is depicted as a vast, awe-inspiring platinum dragon, his scales gleaming with a celestial radiance. His wings are said to span the horizon, while his eyes glow with an ancient, powerful wisdom. His voice is like a deep rumble, comforting yet commanding, carrying the weight of millennia of experience. His appearance radiates purity and strength, and in battle, his very presence is enough to turn the tide in favour of the righteous.

In moments of peace, Mahatu is seen as a calm, towering figure, his claws and teeth tempered by his unwavering commitment to justice. His followers often portray him with a greatsword forged from his own breath, symbolising his readiness to strike down evil wherever it may lurk.

# Personality
Mahatu is a god of unwavering principles, devoted to the protection of the weak and the preservation of justice. He values order and believes that true strength comes from discipline, wisdom, and mercy. Unlike many of his kin, he is not consumed by his draconic nature; instead, he has chosen to transcend it, becoming a symbol of goodness for all beings, not just dragons.

While stern in his judgement of evil, Mahatu is compassionate and merciful to those who seek redemption. His patience is vast, but when evil must be confronted, he acts swiftly and decisively, showing no hesitation in defending the innocent. He is a tactical thinker, often weighing the long-term consequences of his actions to ensure that justice prevails not only in the present but for generations to come.

# Relationships
Once bound to [[../The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]], the goddess of evil dragons, Mahatu was her equal, and together they ruled over the domain of dragons as neutral embodiments of draconic power. However, as life began to take root in Verak’eal, the differences between them became clear. While [[../The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]] sought to dominate and corrupt, Mahatu believed in protecting and uplifting the weak. Their bond shattered, and they became mortal enemies.

Mahatu’s closest allies are gods like [[./Dathin|Dathin]] (god of the sun and light) and [[./Timnar|Timnar]] (god of law), who share his values of justice and protection. Together, they often act as a shield against the forces of darkness. Mahatu views [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], particularly [[../The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]] and [[../The Lost/Fax|Fax]] (god of domination), with contempt, seeing them as direct threats to the order and balance of the world.

# Worshippers
Mahatu’s followers are champions of justice and defenders of the weak. His temples are built like fortresses, often serving as sanctuaries for those in need and training grounds for knights and paladins. His worshippers include dragonborn who see themselves as part of his celestial lineage, as well as humans, elves, and other races who seek to uphold the ideals of honour and righteousness.

His clergy are often skilled warriors or diplomats, as Mahatu encourages both strength in combat and wisdom in governance. They are charged with the protection of the oppressed, the pursuit of justice, and the destruction of evil. His temples hold grand vigils, where his followers meditate on his teachings and prepare themselves to fight in his name.

## Orders
- **The Platinum Guard**: A sacred order of knights and paladins dedicated to Mahatu, they are sworn to protect the weak, enforce justice, and battle evil in all its forms. They are known for their gleaming armour, often crafted with dragon motifs to symbolise their connection to Mahatu.
- **The Vigil of Scales**: A group of dragonborn and sorcerers who draw upon Mahatu’s divine lineage, they serve as his emissaries and guardians, ensuring that his will is known and that dragons remain a force for good in the world.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Honour is the sword that strikes down evil."
- "Justice must be vigilant, for darkness never sleeps."
- "The strength of a true protector lies not in their might, but in their mercy."

# History
Mahatu and [[../The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]] were once two sides of the same coin, embodiments of the raw elemental power of dragons. Together, they ruled their domain with balance, neither good nor evil. But when life began to bloom in Verak’eal, their paths diverged. [[../The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]] was seduced by power and sought to subjugate the weaker creatures, while Mahatu saw himself as their protector, believing that dragons should use their strength to shield the vulnerable.

As [[../The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]]’s heart darkened, Mahatu’s resolve strengthened. When [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] began, he quickly sided with [[../The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]], becoming one of their greatest generals. His leadership in the field was crucial, as his tactical mind and raw power turned the tide in many battles against [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]]. Throughout the war, Mahatu fought not for glory, but to protect the balance of the world and to oppose the growing evil of [[../The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]] and her allies.

After [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], Mahatu returned to his celestial domain, but his presence is still felt in the world through the dragons that bear his bloodline. He continues to watch over the realms, ever vigilant against the resurgence of evil, especially from [[../The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]] and her twisted brood of evil dragons.

# Tenets of Faith
Mahatu’s followers live by these commandments:
- Uphold the highest ideals of honour and justice.
- Be constantly vigilant against evil and oppose it on all fronts.
- Protect the weak, liberate the oppressed, and defend just order.

# Prophets
- **Serenith the Shieldbearer**: A paladin who claimed to have received direct visions from Mahatu, Serenith is known for leading crusades against the forces of evil dragons and oppressive regimes. Her shield is said to have been blessed by Mahatu himself, making her an impenetrable defender.
- **Theron of the Sky**: A dragonborn warrior whose lineage is traced directly to Mahatu, Theron is revered as a living symbol of Mahatu’s justice. He was instrumental in establishing many of the modern dragonborn enclaves that follow Mahatu’s teachings.
