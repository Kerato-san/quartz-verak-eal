**Filan** is the ancient **god of animals**. He was one of the first gods to shape life, creating the beasts that roam Verak'eal. Filan embodies both the fierce savagery and the delicate balance of nature, and he despises the encroachment of civcivilizationto the wilds. Though his true form is unknown, he is often depicted as a great wolf, black as the night or crackling with lightning, depending on the temperament of those who worship him.

# Description
Filan takes many forms, but the most common depictions of him are either a towering black wolf with eyes glowing like stars in the night sky or a massive white wolf made entirely of crackling lightning. His fur seems to blend into the shadows of the forest, or the storm clouds in the sky, depending on his mood. Some stories also describe him as appearing in the form of other great beasts, from towering stags to mighty eagles, embodying the primal strength and untamed freedom of the animals he watches over.

When appearing to mortals, his presence is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, as he radiates the raw power of the wild. His movements are swift, deliberate, and silent as if the wilderness itself flows through him.

# Personality
Filan is a god of primal balance. He does not favour one side of nature over the other, life and death, creation and destruction, predator and prey all have their place in the cycle of the wild. His view of the world is one of balance and harmony, and he does not tolerate those who disrupt this equilibrium, particularly those who clear forests or encroach upon the wilderness for their own gain.

Though revered for his wisdom, Filan is often seen as distant and inscrutable. He is not a god who intoften interferesth mortal affairs unless the natural balance is under severe threat. His followers revere him not for his kindness, but for his raw, untamed power and his understanding of the natural order. To him, savagery is not evil, but a necessary aspect of the wild.

# Relationships
Filan’s closest ally is [[./Nedarin|Nedarin]], goddess of nature, who laid the groundwork for his creation of life. Together, they maintain the balance of the natural world, though Filan’s focus on animals sometimes places him in conflict with the encroachment of civilisations. He shares a respectful, if distant, relationship with [[./Rindra|Rindra]] (goddess of knowledge and discovery), appreciating those who seek to understand nature without seeking to tame it.

Filan harbours a deep enmity towards [[../The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]] (god of destruction), whose unchecked chaos threatens the delicate balance of the wild, and [[../The Lost/Wendel|Wendel]] (god of greed), who represents the worst of mortal excess in the exploitation of nature. He has little interest in the affairs of the Grey or the Lost, preferring to act independently, driven only by the needs of the wild.

# Worshippers
Filan’s followers are often those who live in close connection with nature, such as rangers, druids, and shamans. His most devout worshippers include hunters who seek to live in harmony with the wild, only taking what they need and giving back to the land. Beastmasters and those who tame animals for battle or companionship often invoke Filan’s blessing, trusting in his guidance to strengthen the bond between human and beast.

His temples are not traditional buildings, but sacred groves and hidden glades, where his worshippers come together to honour the cycles of life, death, and rebirth. These places are often fiercely protected from outsiders, who are seen as potential threats to the natural order.

## Orders
- **The Wild Hunt**: A group of Filan’s most devoted followers, who seek out and destroy aberrations, unnatural creatures, and those who would harm the wilderness. They believe that hunting is a sacred act, performed not for sport but to maintain the balance.
- **The Circle of Fangs**: A secretive order of beastmasters and druids who train great wolves and other predators to guard the wild places of Verak’eal. They are often called upon to protect sacred groves and natural sites from those who would seek to exploit them.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Nature does not forgive, nor does it forget."
- "The wild has no need for civilisation's chains."
- "In the hunt, we find the truth of the wild."

# History
Filan was among the first of the gods to shape the world, giving life to the creatures of the wilderness after [[./Nedarin|Nedarin]] crafted the forests, rivers, and plains. In the Age of Gods, he roamed freely across the lands, guiding the animals and ensuring that the balance of predator and prey remained intact. When mortals began to spread across the world, he viewed them with caution, watching as they began to encroach upon the wilderness.

However, when the war between the Grey and the Lost began, the wilds became a battlefield. Filan’s creatures were often caught in the crossfire, either slaughtered as collateral or used as sacrifices by the Lost, who sought to corrupt the natural order for their own gain.

Initially, Filan kept to the deep wilderness, defending his domain and avoiding the conflict. But as the destruction spread, and more of his creatures fell to the brutality of the war, he was forced to act. Reluctantly, he joined the Grey, not out of loyalty to their cause, but to protect the animals and wild places that were being ravaged by the chaos. Filan fought fiercely, ensuring that the wilderness and its creatures would survive the conflict.

# Tenets of Faith
Filan’s followers abide by these commandments:
- Protect the untamed wildernesses of the realm from destruction and overuse. Oppose the rampant spread of cities and empires.
- Hunt aberrant monsters and other abominations of nature that threaten the balance of life.
- Do not fear or condemn the savagery of the wild. Live in harmony with the untamed world, for it is in this savagery that true balance is found.

# Prophets
- **Skalnir the Wild One**: A druid who was said to have been raised by wolves, Skalnir became a legendary protector of the forests. He claimed to commune directly with Filan and led many battles against those who sought to deforest the land.
- **Elandra the Huntress**: Known for her skill with a bow and her deep connection to the animals of the wild, Elandra is revered by Filan’s followers as one who embodied his ideals of balance and harmony. Legends say that she could call upon Filan’s blessing to summon great storms during her hunts.
