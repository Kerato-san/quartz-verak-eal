**Nethin** is the goddess of the moon, secrets, trickery, and illusions. She governs the tides, the mysteries of the night, and the hidden corners of the world, where light cannot fully reach. Nethin is known for her playfulness and her belief that deception and illusion, while often misunderstood, can be forces for good. She delights in subtlety and misdirection, and her followers believe that her guidance can reveal hidden truths that would otherwise remain obscured. However, her playful and mischievous nature leads some to question her true intentions. While most of her followers insist she is a force for good, others whisper that her schemes may serve only her amusement.

# Description
Nethin is typically depicted as a lithe and graceful figure, draped in silvery shadows that shimmer like moonlight on water. Her eyes, glowing softly like the light of the crescent moon, are filled with mystery, constantly shifting in colour and intensity. Her long, flowing hair is often portrayed as either silver or inky black, depending on whether she is seen in her benevolent or mischievous guise. She is always in motion, fading in and out of view as if she were part of the night itself, an ephemeral presence just beyond reach.

In some depictions, she carries a veil that obscures her face, representing the unknowable truths she guards, and a crescent-shaped blade, symbolising her control over the tides and the subtle power she wields in the shadows.

# Personality
Nethin is a complex deity, embodying both the benevolent mysteries of the night and the playful, sometimes chaotic nature of trickery. She values freedom, both of action and thought, and encourages her followers to pursue their passions without fear of judgment. Her trickster nature is playful and clever, often using deception to teach lessons or protect her followers. However, her meddling can sometimes cause unintended chaos, and she is not above using her powers for her own amusement, which has led to a few strained relationships among the gods.

Though her followers believe she ultimately works for the greater good, there are many who question her true motives. Nethin’s propensity for secrets and her tendency to act according to her own whims has sparked rumours that she may have her own hidden agenda, with some doubting whether she truly embodies the forces of good, or whether that too is part of her elaborate ruse.

# Relationships
Nethin's playful and secretive nature often puts her at odds with the more straightforward deities, particularly those of law and order. Her relationship with **Timnar** (god of law) is tense, as he views her deceptions as disruptive to the balance he seeks to maintain. However, she shares a close connection with **Atheca** (goddess of magic), with whom she often collaborates to unlock the arcane mysteries of the world.

She also enjoys a cordial relationship with **Filan** (god of animals), as they both share a love for the wild and untamed, though her trickery sometimes frustrates his more straightforward approach to the natural world. Among the gods, Nethin is most often a mediator between factions, slipping between alliances as it suits her, though her unpredictable nature means she is not fully trusted by any of them.

# Worshippers
Nethin’s followers are a diverse group, ranging from rogues and spies who rely on her protection to illusionists and bards who draw inspiration from her mastery of secrets. Many who walk the shadows or live on the fringes of society pray to Nethin for guidance, trusting in her to shield them from danger or to reveal the truth hidden beneath layers of deception.

Her worshippers celebrate the night and the mysteries it holds. Many temples to Nethin are located in secluded places, hidden in plain sight, or integrated into larger settlements as secret chambers or sanctuaries. There are larger well-known Temples to Nethin meant for the public and the uninitiated. Her priests are skilled in the art of illusion and secrecy, acting as advisers to those seeking hidden knowledge, or as agents working behind the scenes to influence events in her favour.

## Orders
- **The Lunar Veil**: An elite order of spies and illusionists who serve as Nethin’s eyes and ears in the world. They use their skills in deception and trickery to manipulate events, always working toward what they believe is the greater good, though their true purposes are often veiled in secrecy.
- **The Dreamwatchers**: A group of mystics and dream interpreters who believe that Nethin speaks to her followers through dreams and visions. They travel across Verak’eal, offering guidance to those troubled by nightmares and helping individuals understand the hidden messages within their dreams.

## Favoured Sayings
- "In darkness, the truth is revealed."
- "The shadows guard more than just secrets."
- "Not every illusion is meant to deceive."

# History
Nethin’s role in the **Age of Gods** was one of mischief and subtle influence. She meddled in the affairs of both mortals and gods alike, often using her illusions to turn the tide of battle or to expose hidden truths that others wished to keep concealed. Her playful nature earned her both friends and enemies, though her true allegiances remained mysterious throughout the divine conflicts. 

During the **Shatter**, Nethin played a behind-the-scenes role, using her illusions to protect key figures of the **Grey** from assassination and sabotage by the **Lost**. While her efforts were vital to the Grey’s success, some gods questioned whether Nethin had ulterior motives, given her penchant for deception. After the war, she retreated to her Midnight Veil, content to let mortals and gods alike wonder about her true intentions.

# Tenets of Faith
Nethin’s followers abide by these tenets:
- Seize your own destiny by pursuing your passions, unbound by the constraints of others.
- Let the shadows protect you from the blazing light of zealous good and the absolute darkness of evil.
- Walk unbridled and untethered, finding and forging new memories and experiences in life’s hidden corners.

# Prophets
- **Lirae of the Crescent Blade**: A rogue who claimed to have been personally blessed by Nethin, Lirae’s exploits became legendary as she used deception and trickery to outwit her foes, many of whom never knew they had been bested until long after she was gone.
- **Silarion the Dreamwalker**: A mystic who wandered the world interpreting dreams, Silarion claimed that Nethin guided his every step through visions sent during the full moon. His followers believe that Nethin’s dreams can reveal the future, but only to those who can decipher her cryptic messages.
