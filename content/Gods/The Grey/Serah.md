**Serah** is the radiant **goddess of love**, beauty, and passion. She shines her light upon all those who walk the paths of love and encourages mortals to follow their hearts in all matters. Serah believes that love, in its purest form, leads to goodness and joy, and that when love leads to strife, it has been twisted or corrupted. She teaches her followers to embrace their emotions, live with passion, and cherish the bonds they form with others, for love is a sacred force that unites all beings.

# Description
Serah is often depicted as a graceful woman with an aura of warmth and light, radiating joy and love to all who behold her. Her hair is said to be woven from sunlight itself, cascading around her like a golden waterfall, and her eyes shimmer with the depth of compassion and devotion. She is adorned in flowing robes of soft pinks and reds, symbolising the many shades of love, from gentle affection to burning passion.

In her presence, mortals feel an overwhelming sense of comfort and happiness, as though all burdens and sorrows melt away. She is frequently portrayed surrounded by blooming flowers, particularly roses, which are sacred to her and represent the beauty and fragility of love.

# Personality
Serah is a kind and compassionate deity, embodying the purest aspects of love and joy. She encourages her followers to pursue their passions without fear and to embrace love in all its forms, whether it be romantic, platonic, or the deep love one feels for life itself. Her teachings are simple but profound: love leads to goodness, and by following one’s heart, one will always find the right path.

However, Serah is adamant that love must be true and uncorrupted. When love causes pain or leads to conflict, she believes it has been twisted by greed, jealousy, or hatred. To her, the greatest tragedy is the perversion of love into something destructive, and she calls upon her followers to heal such wounds and restore the purity of passion.

Though gentle and kind, Serah is not without her stern side. She despises those who manipulate love for selfish ends and will not hesitate to intervene if she believes a bond has been wrongfully corrupted.

# Relationships
Serah maintains cordial relationships with most deities, for love touches all aspects of life. She is particularly close to [[./Sheleth|Sheleth]] (god of art), who shares her appreciation for beauty and creativity, as well as [[./Kalin|Kalin]] (goddess of success and experimentation), who embodies the joy of pursuing one’s passions.

While Serah generally avoids conflict, she opposes gods who twist love or use it as a tool for manipulation, such as [[../The Lost/Fax|Fax]] (god of domination) and [[../The Lost/Nethira|Nethira]] (goddess of deceit). To Serah, love must be freely given and received, never forced or corrupted, and those who seek to control or exploit it are among her greatest enemies. She also strongly opposes [[../The Lost/Hekoda|Hekoda]] (god of hatred), he is the anthesis of what she is.

When the war between [[../The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] and [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] began, Serah took on a supporting role, working behind the scenes to heal the hearts of those left devastated by loss and ensuring that love would continue to flourish even in the darkest of times. Her power was subtle but immensely important in maintaining morale and unity among [[../The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]].

During [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], Serah focused her energies on comforting those who had lost loved ones in the conflict, ensuring that they found peace even in death.
