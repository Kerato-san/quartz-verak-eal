**Dathin** is the **god of the sun, life, and light**. He is a powerful deity representing the forces of good and compassion in Verak’eal. His light brings healing to the suffering and offers redemption to those who seek it. Dathin believes in the inherent goodness within every mortal and is known for his teachings on mercy and the chance for redemption, even for the darkest souls. His radiance serves as a beacon of hope, lighting the way for those lost in darkness.

# Description
Dathin often manifests as a towering, radiant figure draped in flowing white and gold robes. His form seems to emanate a warm, golden glow, so bright that few can look upon him directly without being overwhelmed by the sheer intensity of his light. His eyes are orbs of pure radiance, and his hair flows like molten sunlight. Dathin’s mere presence is soothing, and his touch is said to be able to heal the gravest of wounds and restore hope to the despairing. His voice is calm yet powerful, like a comforting ray of sunlight at dawn.

# Personality
Dathin is a gentle yet powerful force of good. He is characterized by his boundless compassion and unwavering belief in the potential for redemption. His patience is legendary, and he is always willing to give even the most wayward soul a second chance. However, this compassion is balanced by his firm stance against evil. Dathin does not hesitate to shine his light into the darkest places, confronting and purging evil wherever it festers. His followers often take on the mantle of healers and peacemakers, but they also stand as stalwart protectors of the innocent, using Dathin’s light to drive back the shadows.

Though loved for his mercy, Dathin's focus on redemption is sometimes considered naive by other gods, as he sometimes places trust in those who might not deserve it. Yet, Dathin’s belief in the possibility of change remains unshaken.

# Relationships
Dathin is closely allied with [[./The Porcelain Queen|The Porcelain Queen]], with whom he devised the plan to end the influence of the gods and bring about the Shatter. Though their natures are the opposite of each other, they share a deep respect for one another's purpose. Dathin’s other allies include gods such as [[./Mahatu|Mahatu]], the god of good dragons, and [[./Timnar|Timnar]], god of law, with whom he shares a desire for a just and righteous world.

Dathin harbours a deep enmity for the Lost, particularly [[../The Lost/Fax|Fax]], the god of domination, and [[../The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]], the goddess of evil dragons, who he sees as perversions of power and greed. He also stands in opposition to [[../The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]], the god of destruction, as their philosophies are fundamentally at odds.

# Worshippers
Dathin’s followers are devoted to bringing light into dark places, both literally and figuratively. They believe in acts of charity, healing, and protecting those in need. Clerics of Dathin often operate hospitals, sanctuaries, and places of respite for the downtrodden. His paladins are relentless crusaders against evil, bringing justice to those who would prey upon the weak. Many of his faithful are also drawn to his doctrine of redemption, working tirelessly to rehabilitate criminals and offer a path to salvation for those who have strayed.

Worshippers refer to Dathin in prayers at dawn, and many of his rituals take place in the light of the rising sun, symbolizing new beginnings. Funerals in his faith are held at dusk, symbolizing the journey of the soul towards the eternal light.

# History
Dathin played a pivotal role in the Age of Gods, working alongside [[./The Porcelain Queen|The Porcelain Queen]] to enact the Shatter, which ended the war with the Lost by dividing the planes and confining the gods’ influence. His role in the Shatter cemented his place as a god of light and hope, but also one who understood the necessity of limiting divine power for the greater good.

His light has not dimmed in the years since, and he remains a key figure in the Grey Pantheon. Many mortals revere Dathin for his role in keeping the Lost at bay, though some criticize his unwavering optimism and his belief that even the most corrupted souls can be redeemed.

- Relieve the suffering of the innocent wherever it exists.

- Perform acts of goodness so overwhelming that evil has no room in which to exist.
