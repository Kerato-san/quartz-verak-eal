**The Porcelain Queen** is the enigmatic and anonymous **goddess of death, fate, and the passage of souls**. She rules over the transition between life and death, ensuring that every soul follows its destined path. The Queen is a stern but fair guardian, dedicated to maintaining the balance of life and death, free from emotion or bias. Her authority over death is absolute, and she does not tolerate any deviation from the natural order, particularly the horrors of undeath. Clad in mystery, her true name has been erased from existence, and her face is never seen, hidden behind a simple porcelain mask.

# Description
The Porcelain Queen appears as a tall, regal figure clad in flowing robes of grey and black, symbolizing the finality of death and the weight of judgement. Her most distinct feature is the smooth, featureless porcelain mask she wears, which obscures her face entirely. The mask’s simplicity contrasts with the intricate beauty of the raven feathers that adorn her robes, falling around her like whispers of death itself. In her hand, she often carries a scythe or a ceremonial blade, tools she uses not for violence, but to sever the ties between the living and the dead.

Her eyes, unseen behind the mask, are said to pierce through the souls of mortals, weighing their fates with cold precision. Ravens are her constant companions, serving as her messengers and the watchers of souls. It is said that when a raven circles overhead, the Queen is near, ready to collect the soul of the soon-to-be departed.

# Personality
The Porcelain Queen is the embodiment of impartiality and inevitability. She does not take joy in death, nor does she mourn it. She sees it as a necessary part of existence, the final step in the cycle of life. Her demeanour is calm, deliberate, and entirely without malice or favour. While she is stern in her judgements, her fairness is unquestioned; she treats all souls equally, whether they were kings or peasants in life.

Her mysterious nature and the secrecy surrounding her origins have led to a mixture of reverence and fear among mortals. While many respect her for the fairness she brings to death, others regard her with suspicion, believing that her anonymity hides something darker. The fact that she chooses to remain unknown, even to her most devout followers, only deepens the mystique that surrounds her.

# Relationships
The Porcelain Queen has a distant relationship with the other gods, acting as a neutral arbiter in matters of death and fate. Her only concern is the orderly transition of souls, and she shows little interest in the power struggles of the divine. However, she has a mutual respect for [[./Dathin|Dathin]] (god of the sun), as their domains—life and death—are inextricably linked. They share the goal of maintaining balance, though [[./Dathin|Dathin]]’s emphasis on redemption contrasts with her focus on finality.

The Queen holds a deep enmity towards any deity or force that promotes undeath. [[../The Lost/Nethira|Nethira]] (goddess of deceit) and [[../The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]] (god of destruction) are among her greatest foes, as they both seek to disrupt the natural order through the perversion of death or the destruction of the soul’s journey. Her hatred for undeath is so profound that her followers actively hunt down necromancers and those who would defile the sanctity of death.

# Worshippers
The Porcelain Queen’s worshippers are a solemn and dedicated group, many of whom serve as caretakers of the dead or arbiters of fate. Judges, executioners, and those responsible for ensuring the finality of death often invoke her name, seeking her guidance to remain impartial in their duties. Necromancers who serve her are not concerned with raising the dead, but with communing with spirits and ensuring that the souls they encounter follow their destined path to the afterlife.

Her temples are austere and quiet, often located near graveyards or places of mourning. These temples serve as sanctuaries for those who seek to understand death or come to terms with their own fate. Funerary rites performed by her clergy are meticulous and revered, ensuring that each soul is sent to the Sea of Death where it may rest.

## Orders
- **The Raven's Call**: A secretive order of clerics and monks who ensure that the dead are properly buried and the souls released. They also serve as agents of the Queen’s justice, hunting down those who defy fate or seek to escape death through unnatural means.
- **The Order of Silent Faces**: An elite group of morticians and fateweavers who are responsible for overseeing the final rites of kings and nobles, ensuring that their souls follow their predestined path without interference. Their members are known to wear porcelain masks in honour of their goddess.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Death is not to be feared, but respected."
- "Fate's chain is unbroken."
- "The dead rest free of all judgement, save her own."

# History
The Porcelain Queen’s rise to power began with her overthrow of the previous god of death, the **Death Tyrant**, a cruel and despotic ruler who sought to enslave souls even after death. The Queen, once a mortal herself, defied the Death Tyrant and led a rebellion to liberate the souls trapped in his dominion. After a long and bitter struggle, she defeated the Tyrant, claiming his throne and ensuring that death would be a fair and natural process. 

Upon ascending to godhood, the Porcelain Queen erased her mortal name and identity from existence, severing all ties to her past life to ensure her complete neutrality in the matter of death. She then took residence in the **Citadel of Souls**, a great fortress on the shores of the **Sea of Death**, where she watches over the souls that pass through. She ensures that they are freed from the burdens of life and judged only by the merits of their fate.

Her anonymity and secretive nature have led to widespread speculation about who she once was, with many myths claiming she was a mortal queen or priestess who defied fate and death itself. However, the truth remains hidden behind her porcelain mask, and no god or mortal has ever uncovered her true identity.

# Tenets of Faith
The Porcelain Queen’s followers adhere to these principles:
- Hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life.
- Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. As the instrument of the Porcelain Queen, you must punish hubris where you find it.
- Undeath is an atrocity. Those who would pervert the transition of the soul must be brought down.

# Prophets
- **Thane of the Last Breath**: A warrior who was said to have been visited by the Porcelain Queen on his deathbed, Thane was granted the strength to rise one final time to protect his people from an undead horde. After his final act of heroism, he willingly passed into her realm, where his spirit is said to guard the Sea of Death.
- **Elenara the Masked**: A cleric of the Queen, Elenara was known for her ability to speak with the dead and ensure their peaceful transition to the afterlife. She wore a porcelain mask throughout her life, claiming it allowed her to better understand the Queen’s will, and is now venerated as a saint among the Queen’s followers.
