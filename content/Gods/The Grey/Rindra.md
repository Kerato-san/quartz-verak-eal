**Rindra**, the **Goddess of Knowledge and Discovery**, is the embodiment of curiosity, truth, and the eternal pursuit of wisdom. Rindra believes that through knowledge, societies can rise above ignorance, deception, and chaos, fostering balance and growth. Her teachings inspire her followers to seek truth and share it freely, spreading enlightenment across the world of Verak’eal.

# Description
Rindra is typically depicted as a regal, older woman with flowing robes covered in intricate patterns of ancient scripts and symbols. Her eyes are said to hold galaxies within them, representing the vast knowledge she guards and the mysteries yet to be uncovered. She carries a glowing lantern in one hand, symbolising the light of understanding, while an open tome rests in the other, representing the accumulation of knowledge. She is serene and calm, with an aura of quiet authority that speaks to her mastery over all things intellectual.

Her domain, the **Archive Eternal**, is an infinite library where every scroll, tome, and fragment of knowledge ever recorded resides. It is a realm of order, where scholars and seekers of truth can find answers to any question, provided they know how to ask the right questions. There, the greatest minds from across the planes come to study and preserve the lore of the multiverse.

# Personality
Rindra is a patient and measured deity, valuing careful thought and deliberation over rash action. She seeks balance in all things, particularly in the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge. She is driven by a desire to see the world enlightened and believes that understanding is the key to harmony. Though neutral in alignment, Rindra’s followers are encouraged to use their knowledge for the betterment of society, teaching others and guiding those who stray into ignorance.

Rindra despises lies, deception, and the withholding of truth. To her, falsehoods are a form of corruption that clouds the minds of mortals and prevents true progress. She encourages her followers to always seek the truth, even if it is difficult to face, and to challenge those who would obscure reality for personal gain. Though neutral, she has no tolerance for those who use knowledge for malicious purposes, believing that the truth should never be twisted for evil ends.

# Relationships
Rindra, a goddess of knowledge, maintains a distant but practical relationship with many gods, forming alliances when it benefits the pursuit and preservation of knowledge. However, her unwavering dedication to truth and discovery has earned her both allies and enemies.

Rindra also maintains a cordial relationship with [[./Kalin|Kalin]], goddess of success and experimentation, though their approaches sometimes differ. While [[./Kalin|Kalin]] favours constant action and experimentation, Rindra prefers a more calculated approach, ensuring that knowledge is understood before being applied. This difference can lead to friction between their followers, though the two deities ultimately respect one another’s domains.

Rindra holds a strong alliance with [[./Timnar|Timnar]], the god of law, as both believe in structured progress, with truth and order as vital components of a fair and just society. [[./Timnar|Timnar]]’s followers often work with Rindra’s scholars to uncover lost laws or codes that can improve civilization. Rindra respects [[./Sheleth|Sheleth]], the god of art, for the creativity and beauty that comes from true artistic inspiration. Though they approach creation differently, both gods understand the power of a legacy, be it a work of art or a piece of preserved knowledge. [[./Varida|Varida]], the Stone Mother, also aligns well with Rindra, as the goddess of forge and stone respects those who seek to perfect their craft and contribute to the lasting legacy of society. Both appreciate careful construction, whether of stone or ideas.

Rindra has a deep disdain for [[./Nethin|Nethin]], the chaotic goddess of secrets and trickery. While they were begrudging allies during the Shatter as part of The Grey, Rindra could never truly trust [[./Nethin|Nethin]]'s deceptive ways, and the tension between their ideals was palpable. She also despises [[../The Lost/Nethira|Nethira]], the dark counterpart of [[./Nethin|Nethin]], for spreading ignorance and illusions. The deceitful actions of both deities directly oppose Rindra’s pursuit of truth. Rindra also harbours enmity towards [[../The Lost/Wendel|Wendel]], the god of greed, who hoards wealth and knowledge for personal gain without sharing it for the betterment of society.

# History
**Rindra’s Role in the Age of Gods**  
Rindra’s influence stretches back to the earliest days of civilisation, when mortals first began to write and record their history. It was Rindra who inspired the first scholars to record their knowledge, ensuring that it would not be lost to the ages. She helped guide the development of written language, libraries, and schools, believing that education was the key to lifting mortals out of the chaos of ignorance.

**Rindra and the Shatter**  
During the Shatter, Rindra played a crucial role in maintaining the balance between knowledge and power. She understood that, without understanding, power could lead to destruction, and so she worked tirelessly to preserve the ancient lore and artefacts that could help guide the mortals and gods through the tumultuous times. Her followers were often called upon to advise leaders and generals, ensuring that decisions were based on careful study rather than impulsive action. Though she did not fight directly, her wisdom helped prevent the loss of crucial knowledge during the conflict.

After the Shatter, Rindra focused on rebuilding the world’s knowledge base, ensuring that the wisdom of the past would not be forgotten and that mortals would have the tools they needed to create a better future.

# Tenets of Faith
Rindra’s followers adhere to these commandments:

- Accumulate, preserve, and distribute knowledge in all forms. Pursue education, build libraries, and seek out lost and ancient lore.
- Condemn those who lie, even among your allies, for evil folk gain power when their followers obscure the truth. Never stoop to the level of liars.
