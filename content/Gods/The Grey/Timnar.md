**Timnar** is the god of law, justice, and order. He believes that civilization is built on the foundations of law, and that only by upholding strict principles can a society achieve true fairness and balance. Timnar is a stern but just deity, revered by those who value structure, discipline, and righteousness. While some view him as overly strict, his followers know that Timnar’s path is one that leads to stability and justice for all.

# Description
Timnar is often depicted as a towering figure, clad in gleaming silver armour, with a great hammer in one hand and a set of golden scales in the other. His presence is commanding, and his gaze is said to pierce the hearts of the unjust, weighing their every action against the strictures of the law. He is often shown standing before a grand courthouse, representing his role as the ultimate arbiter of justice. His stern face rarely betrays emotion, but his followers know that behind the unyielding exterior is a deep sense of fairness and a commitment to order.

In some depictions, a radiant light emanates from his armour, symbolizing the clarity and purity of the law. His voice is said to echo like thunder, clear and unwavering in its pronouncements, as he delivers judgement with both precision and finality.

# Personality
Timnar is unwavering in his belief that law is the bedrock of civilization. He teaches that the rules that govern society must be respected and constantly improved upon to ensure justice for all. His philosophy is simple: to bend the rules is to invite chaos, and chaos only leads to destruction. Timnar’s dedication to order means that he expects his followers to adhere strictly to the letter of the law, no matter the circumstances. While this can make him seem inflexible, Timnar’s intentions are always noble. He seeks a world where justice is accessible to all, and where laws protect rather than oppress. This means that laws should always be refined, but only through proper and lawful channels.

Timnar is a firm but benevolent god, valuing truth, honour, and loyalty above all. He believes that duty must come before personal desire, and that every individual has a responsibility to uphold the law and contribute to the greater good of society. However, his rigid approach can lead to tension with more free-spirited deities or mortals who value personal freedom over structure.

# Relationships
Timnar’s closest allies are gods of justice, protection, and creation, with whom he shares a vision of a just and structured world. He has a close partnership with **[[./Dinarul|Dinarul]]** (god of craft and perfection), as both deities believe in the importance of structure and discipline. Together, they are often invoked by builders of civilization, whether through laws, crafts, or architecture.

However, Timnar has a complicated relationship with **[[./Atheca|Atheca]]** (goddess of magic and chaos). He respects her knowledge but despises her chaotic nature, viewing her disregard for rules as dangerous. Their followers often clash in matters of law versus freedom, with [[./Atheca|Atheca]]’s wizards pushing boundaries while Timnar’s paladins seek to impose order.

Timnar also has a strong enmity with the deities of destruction and deception, particularly **[[../The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]]** (god of destruction) and **[[./Nethin|Nethin]]** (goddess of trickery). He views their actions as a direct threat to the order he strives to maintain, and considers their followers dangerous forces of chaos and corruption.

# History
Timnar played a central role during the **Age of Gods**, where his influence helped shape the first laws that governed both gods and mortals alike. He believed that without structure, the world would fall into chaos, and so he tirelessly worked to create a set of universal laws that could guide civilization forward. His teachings became the cornerstone of many early societies, laying the foundation for governments, courts, and military orders dedicated to preserve the peace.

During the **Shatter**, when the Grey fought against the Lost, Timnar’s role became one of discipline and order. While chaos raged across the planes, Timnar stood firm, ensuring that the armies of the Grey were organized, lawful, and focused. He crafted strategies that balanced defence with justice, ensuring that the Grey upheld their ideals even in the heat of battle. Many believe that without Timnar’s guidance, the Grey would have succumbed to the chaos unleashed by the Lost gods.

In the aftermath of the Shatter, Timnar’s influence continued to shape civilizations. His worshippers sought to rebuild and improve the laws that had been fractured during the divine conflict, holding firm to his belief that law is never complete—it must evolve to achieve true justice for all. Timnar’s followers now spread his teachings, ensuring that the letter of the law is followed, and that civilization can thrive under its protection.
