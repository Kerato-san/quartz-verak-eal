**Nedarin** is the **goddess of nature** and the protector of all plant life across Verak'eal. Her domain encompasses the forests, jungles, and groves that fill the world, creating a rich and vibrant landscape for all living creatures. As the first deity to bring life into the barren wastelands, she paved the way for the balance of nature to take root. Nedarin views the world through the lens of growth, harmony, and the cyclical beauty of life and death in the natural world.

# Description
Nedarin is often depicted as a towering woman entwined with nature, her hair made of cascading vines and flowers that bloom in response to her emotions. Her skin is a rich, earthen brown, with veins of glowing green that pulse with the life force of the world. She carries a staff made of living wood, adorned with blossoms and leaves. At times, her form shifts, blending into the trees, becoming one with the forest around her. When she speaks, her voice is like the rustling of leaves in the wind, soothing yet full of power.

She embodies both the gentle growth of nature and its fierce, untamed power. While she is often portrayed in peaceful settings, such as serene forests or blooming gardens, her wild side can emerge when nature is threatened, displaying the wrath of storms and the relentless force of the untamed wilderness.

# Personality
Nedarin is the embodiment of balance within the natural world. She neither favours the wild over civilization, nor does she cling to untamed lands over managed growth. Her primary concern is that nature is respected and allowed to flourish, whether in its raw form or within cities that incorporate it. Unlike other nature gods who might despise civilization, Nedarin understands that growth is inevitable and that harmony between nature and civilization can be achieved.

Her temperament is often calm and nurturing, though she can become fiercely protective when the natural balance is disturbed. She views the cycle of life and death as essential, with decay feeding new growth. However, those who exploit nature for greed or recklessly destroy it earn her ire. Her followers are expected to respect the land and live in harmony with its rhythms.

# Relationships
Nedarin holds a close and mutual relationship with [[./Filan|Filan]], as their domains are deeply interconnected. She provides the forests, plains, and jungles that his animals inhabit, and together they maintain the balance of the natural world. While their natures are different—[[./Filan|Filan]] representing the untamed and savage aspects of the wild and Nedarin embodying its nurturing growth—they share a deep respect for each other's purpose.

Nedarin also enjoys a working relationship with [[./Rindra|Rindra]] (goddess of knowledge), who catalogues the many plants and natural phenomena of Verak'eal. However, her views on the expansion of civilization often put her at odds with [[./Dinarul|Dinarul]] (god of creation), who pushes for constant building and progress. She does not despise cities or the advancement of societies, but she insists that they must incorporate nature rather than smother it.

# Worshippers
Nedarin’s followers include druids, farmers, herbalists, and those who live off the land. They are often devoted to the preservation of nature and the sustainable use of its resources. Her temples are often open groves or sacred forests rather than constructed buildings, places where her worshippers can feel the pulse of nature around them. These groves are cared for with great reverence, and rituals often include planting trees, blessing crops, and giving thanks for the bounties of the earth.

Her worshippers are encouraged to live in harmony with their surroundings, taking only what they need and giving back whenever possible. They often serve as caretakers of the land, ensuring that natural areas are preserved even as civilization grows. Her clergy are not necessarily opposed to cities, but they are strong advocates for parks, gardens, and green spaces within urban environments.

## Orders
- **The Verdant Order**: A druidic circle dedicated to the preservation of natural life. They are often called upon to restore balance to areas affected by deforestation or over-farming.
- **The Circle of Harmony**: An order of priests and herbalists who focus on integrating nature into cities and settlements, ensuring that the growth of civilisation does not come at the cost of the natural world.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Nature endures, and so must we."
- "In the seed lies the potential for endless growth."
- "Respect the earth, and it shall provide."

# History
Nedarin was among the first gods to shape the world, bringing verdant life to barren lands. She created the forests, plains, and jungles that would become the home for countless creatures. During the Age of Gods, Nedarin's influence spread, as the natural world flourished across Verak'eal. Her ability to create life attracted the attention of other gods, particularly [[./Filan|Filan]], who saw the landscapes she crafted as the perfect environment for his animals.

As mortals began to establish civilizations, Nedarin did not oppose their expansion, provided that they respected the natural balance. However, during the war between [[../The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] and [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], many of her forests were ravaged, burned, or corrupted. Nedarin joined [[../The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] in their struggle to preserve the natural world from the devastation wrought by [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], ensuring that nature would endure through [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]]. After the conflict, she focused on restoring the damaged lands, nurturing the forests back to their full glory.

# Tenets of Faith
Nedarin’s followers adhere to these guiding principles:
- Preserve nature wherever you can, and replace all trees cut down by man.
- Live in harmony with the woods, as it will provide for you and yours.
- Respect nature in all its splendour, and revere the world in all its natural beauty.

# Prophets
- **Elynra Greenleaf**: A druid who is said to have restored vast areas of deforested land through rituals taught to her by Nedarin. Elynra’s grove, a once-barren wasteland now transformed into a vibrant forest, is considered one of the most sacred sites of Nedarin's faith.
- **Thara of the Vine**: A herbalist who spread Nedarin’s teachings to city dwellers, showing them how to live in harmony with nature even in the heart of urban life. She is credited with the creation of some of the first city gardens, which are now thriving oases within the most populated regions of Verak’eal.
