**Sheleth** is the god of art, beauty, and creation, as well as the divine creator of the elven race. Believing that life without beauty is life without meaning, Sheleth is dedicated to the creation and appreciation of all forms of art, from the finest song to the most intricately forged weapon. Sheleth crafted the elves from raw magic, infusing them with grace and beauty, and granting them a lifespan far beyond other mortals as a reflection of divine elegance.

# Description
Sheleth is often depicted as a radiant, androgynous figure, with graceful features that reflect both masculine and feminine traits. Their form shimmers with an ethereal light, and their attire is constantly changing, appearing as flowing robes of colour and light, sometimes resembling paint or pure energy. In some depictions, Sheleth holds a longbow or a brush, symbolising their skill both in the arts of war and creation.

Their eyes, glowing with the hues of a rainbow, are said to see beauty in all things, even where others cannot. They speak with a voice like a melody, weaving inspiration and wonder with every word.

# Personality
Sheleth is a kind and benevolent deity, but their passion for beauty and art can make them seem distant to those who lack an appreciation for the arts. They believe that beauty can be found in all things, whether in nature, magic, combat, or craftsmanship, and encourage their followers to seek out and create that beauty in every aspect of life. 

Though they are compassionate and generous with inspiration, Sheleth is not without a firm hand. They are fiercely protective of their creations, especially the elves, and will defend beauty wherever it is threatened. Their conflict with **[[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]** is deeply personal, and Sheleth spares no mercy for the followers of the Centipede Queen who seek to corrupt or destroy beauty.

# Relationships
Sheleth’s relationship with **[[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]** is one of bitter enmity. Once close companions, their ideologies grew increasingly opposed as [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]’s hunger for power led her to corrupt the elven race. When Sheleth discovered this betrayal, they cursed [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]] and cast her into the Underdark, marking the beginning of the eternal enmity between the two deities. Sheleth is committed to either redeeming the drow who have fallen under [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]'s sway or destroying those who cannot be saved.

Sheleth maintains cordial relationships with deities of creation and beauty, particularly **[[./Dinarul|Dinarul]]** (god of craft and perfection), as they both value the process of creation, though in different ways. Sheleth’s chaotic good nature sometimes puts them at odds with deities of law and order, but their focus on beauty often allows for understanding across divine divides.

# Worshippers
Sheleth is worshipped by a wide variety of followers, including elves, artists, musicians, and those who seek inspiration in all forms of creation. Their temples are places of artistic expression, filled with paintings, sculptures, and performances. Clerics of Sheleth are known to be patrons of the arts, supporting and nurturing talent wherever it can be found. Their worshippers include those who work with their hands as much as their minds, from architects to jewelcrafters, all inspired by Sheleth’s teachings.

Many elves revere Sheleth not only because of their shared divine lineage but also because Sheleth’s blood, used to bring life to the first elves, granted them their remarkable longevity. Though the elves' immortality faded after the **Shatter**, their extended lifespan remains a symbol of Sheleth’s grace.

## Orders
- **The Eternal Muses**: An order of wandering bards and artists dedicated to spreading beauty and inspiration throughout the world. They are devoted to both creating and preserving art in all its forms.
- **The Sculptor’s Blade**: A militant order dedicated to defending beauty in all forms. They are sworn to combat the followers of [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]], believing that corruption must be eradicated to protect the beauty of the world.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Beauty is eternal, even if fleeting."
- "To create is to touch the divine."
- "Let no soul be lost to corruption if it can be saved."

# History
At the dawn of the **Age of Gods**, Sheleth sought to fill the world with beauty, believing that true art was an expression of life itself. Using raw magic as their canvas, Sheleth sculpted the first elves, beings of unparalleled grace and perfection, imbued with a love for art, magic, and the natural world. To bring them fully to life, Sheleth gave a drop of their own divine blood, which not only animated the elves but also granted them near-immortality, tying their fates to the god of beauty. These elves were intended to live in harmony with the world, to create and inspire, reflecting the beauty Sheleth saw in all things.
 
Among the gods, Sheleth shared a close bond with **[[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]**, who at that time was a trusted ally and friend. [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]], however, grew jealous of Sheleth's influence over the elves and desired control over their destiny. Slowly, [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]] began to corrupt a portion of the elves, seducing them with promises of power, twisting their beauty and grace into something darker. When Sheleth finally discovered [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]’s betrayal, it was too late; many elves had already fallen under [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]’s sway, their once pure hearts darkened by ambition and deceit.

Enraged by this corruption of their creations, Sheleth cursed [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]], transforming her into a monstrous centipede-like form and banishing her into the depths of the Underdark. The elves who had followed [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]] into the shadows were further warped by the Underdark’s corrupting influence, becoming the drow.

When the war between the **Grey** and the **Lost** erupted, Sheleth fought fiercely on the side of the Grey. Their motive was not only to protect the beauty of creation but also to ensure that their beloved elves and other races could continue to exist in a world free from the destructive influences of the Lost gods. Sheleth used their mastery of magic and creation to craft powerful artefacts, weapons, and defences for the Grey, imbuing each item with artistic beauty and practical might.

Throughout the **Shatter**, Sheleth’s focus remained on preserving the beauty of the world, even as war raged. They worked tirelessly to protect the elves, guiding them in battle, but also suffering the pain of watching more of their creations fall to the corruption of [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]. The battle between Sheleth and [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]] became one of ideology as much as power, with Sheleth defending freedom, creativity, and beauty, while [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]] spread her doctrine of ambition, deceit, and cruelty.

After the Shatter, the gods’ direct influence over the world was greatly diminished, but Sheleth’s bond with the elves stayed strong. Sheleth seized this opportunity to extend a hand of redemption to those drow who had been enslaved by [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]’s dark influence. Sheleth offered forgiveness and a path back to the light for those who would abandon [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]’s cruel ways and return to the embrace of beauty, creativity, and freedom. Many drow who were weary of the constant betrayal and ambition of their kind accepted this offer.

However, Sheleth was not without a darker edge when dealing with [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]]’s loyal followers. For those who refused redemption, who continued to worship [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]] and spread her corruption, Sheleth’s mercy ended. These drow were hunted relentlessly by Sheleth’s most loyal followers. In Sheleth’s eyes, these drow were not merely lost souls. They were an affront to the beauty of life, and their destruction is a necessary evil to preserve the greater good.

# Tenets of Faith
Their followers adhere to these commandments:
- Find beauty in all that you do, whether you’re casting a spell, composing a saga, strumming a lute, or practising the arts of war.
- Strive to create something so beautiful it will never be forgotten, even if it is destroyed.
- Stand against the followers of [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]] and all who seek to corrupt beauty, whether in art or in the soul.

# Prophets
- **Elorin the Sculptor**: A legendary elven artist who claimed to receive visions from Sheleth, guiding their hands as they crafted statues of unparalleled beauty. It is said that Sheleth wept tears of joy upon seeing Elorin’s masterpiece, which now resides in the Glimmering Grove.
- **Serenna the Redeemed**: A former follower of [[../The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]], Serenna turned to Sheleth after witnessing the destruction caused by her previous goddess. She became a champion of Sheleth’s cause, leading efforts to redeem drow and reclaim beauty from the clutches of corruption.
