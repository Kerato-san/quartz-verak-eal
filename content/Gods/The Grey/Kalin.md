**Kalin** is the goddess of success, experimentation, and progress. A chaotic good deity, she motivates mortals to take risks, experiment, and continuously move forward. Kalin revels in new ideas, pushing boundaries, and helping mortals evolve through trial and error. Her divine presence fuels creativity and perseverance, encouraging those who worship her to never give up and to keep refining their crafts. Kalin’s influence is felt in every breakthrough, invention, and bold new idea.

# Description
Kalin is often depicted as a young, energetic figure, her appearance constantly shifting to reflect the latest innovation or trend. She is usually shown wearing dynamic, colourful garments that seem to be in constant motion, as though they themselves are being formed and reformed. Her most striking feature is a pair of golden wings, symbolising the rapid ascent of new ideas, and she is often depicted with tools in hand—sometimes a quill, sometimes a hammer, or sometimes something entirely new. Her eyes sparkle with creativity, as if they see endless possibilities in everything around her.

Her divine realm, the **Infinite Workshop**, is a chaotic but vibrant place filled with half-finished inventions, blueprints, and magical constructs. There, Kalin is constantly experimenting with new ideas, testing boundaries, and encouraging her followers to embrace the unpredictable path of creation.

# Personality
Kalin embodies energy, enthusiasm, and relentless positivity. She is a goddess who favours action and spontaneity, believing that it is better to try and fail than to never try at all. Her teachings focus on resilience—she is a patron to those who continue to push forward despite setbacks and failures. For Kalin, the journey of discovery is just as important as the success at the end of it, and she teaches her followers that change is inevitable, but progress is a choice.

Though she is often seen as chaotic and unpredictable, Kalin’s ultimate goal is to ensure that mortals keep striving toward new horizons. She despises complacency and sees stagnation as the enemy of all growth. Her constant motivation pushes her followers to explore every idea, break conventions, and question what is considered impossible.

# Relationships
Kalin often collaborates with deities who value progress, invention, and change. She has a close relationship with **[[./Atheca|Atheca]]**, goddess of magic, as both encourage experimentation and pushing the limits of what is known. Their followers often overlap, with wizards and scholars combining Kalin’s boldness with [[./Atheca|Atheca]]’s arcane mastery to unlock powerful new spells and artefacts.

However, Kalin’s approach to progress sometimes puts her at odds with gods who favour tradition and order. **[[./Timnar|Timnar]]**, god of law, finds her chaotic methods reckless, while **[[./Dinarul|Dinarul]]**, god of craft and perfection, sees her constant experimentation as unfocused. Despite these tensions, Kalin respects their roles in the balance of creation, though she often pushes them to think beyond their boundaries.

She has a friendly rivalry with **[[./Rindra|Rindra]]**, the goddess of knowledge and discovery. While both deities value knowledge, Kalin pushes for the bold application of new discoveries, whereas [[./Rindra|Rindra]] prefers careful preservation and dissemination of information. This tension often leads to collaboration, but it can also result in friction, especially when Kalin’s followers rush ahead without fully understanding the consequences of their innovations.

# Worshippers
Kalin’s followers are bold individuals who thrive on creativity, invention, and exploration. Merchants, inventors, and innovators are drawn to her for guidance in their endeavours, believing that with her favour, they can succeed in bringing their ideas to life. Her temples are often vibrant, chaotic places, filled with workshops, laboratories, and spaces for experimentation. These temples double as guild halls for artisans, alchemists, and entrepreneurs, who share their discoveries and push each other toward greater heights.

Her clergy act as mentors and motivators, encouraging those under their care to take risks and think outside the box. Kalin’s festivals often celebrate new ideas, with competitions to see who can come up with the most creative inventions or solutions to problems.

## Orders
- **The Order of the Endless Horizon**: A group of inventors and scholars who dedicate themselves to pushing the boundaries of knowledge and innovation. They believe that there are no limits to what mortals can achieve with enough experimentation and perseverance.
- **The Wings of Commerce**: A guild of traders and entrepreneurs who follow Kalin’s teachings, embracing risk and chance in their business dealings. They often lead the charge in introducing new goods, trade routes, and methods of commerce.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Luck favours the bold."
- "Failure is just the first step toward success."
- "Keep moving, for progress waits for no one."

# History
**Kalin and the Rise of Mortals**  
Kalin’s influence was crucial in the early development of mortal society, particularly in the realms of commerce, magic, and invention. She was the first to inspire merchants to experiment with new methods of trade, helping them introduce the concept of currency, bartering, and complex market systems. Her hand also guided the early development of magic and science, encouraging mortals to approach their studies with trial and error rather than fear of failure.

**Kalin’s Role in the Shatter**  
During the **Shatter**, Kalin stood firmly with the **Grey**, promoting innovative strategies to counter the chaos of the **Lost**. She motivated the armies of the Grey to experiment with new tactics, leading to unexpected victories. Her relentless positivity helped keep spirits high during the darkest times, as she reminded mortals and gods alike that even in failure, there are lessons to be learned.

After the Shatter, Kalin focused on rebuilding the world, inspiring her followers to innovate and experiment as they restored civilisation. Many of the post-Shatter advancements in magic, commerce, and technology are attributed to her influence, as her followers continued to push boundaries and seek out new ways to better the world.

Kalin’s followers adhere to these guiding principles:
- Luck favours the bold. Your fate is your own to grasp, and to do so is to have Kalin behind you.
- Change is inevitable. The righteous can ensure that such change is for the better.
- Failure is not a reason to stop trying, but rather to keep trying.

# Prophets

- **Arin Firebrand**: A merchant and explorer who pushed trade routes into unexplored lands, bringing back rare goods and knowledge. Arin’s daring ventures were often blessed by Kalin, and she is credited with establishing the first cross-continental trade networks.
