**The Grey** is a collective of deities united by a common goal: to protect the mortal realm from the overwhelming influence of divine powers, both good and evil. Formed in the aftermath of rising conflicts between the gods, The Grey emerged to prevent the destructive consequences of unchecked godly intervention in the material world. Their mission culminated in [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], a catastrophic yet necessary event that split the once singular realm into multiple planes, imprisoning the gods in their respective domains and safeguarding mortal existence.

# History
In the ancient Age of Gods, the deities of Verak’eal walked freely among mortals, shaping the world with their immense powers. Over time, the gods of evil, known as [[./The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], began to grow in strength, corrupting the world and spreading chaos. As their influence grew, the other gods soon became alarmed, realizing that the unchecked power of [[./The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] would lead to the destruction of the world. War soon erupted between the factions, with battles that tore across the realm.

Seeing the suffering inflicted upon mortals, [[./The Grey/Dathin|Dathin]] and [[./The Grey/The Porcelain Queen|The Porcelain Queen]] devised a plan to end the conflict. Their goal was to contain the influence of all gods, both good and evil, by separating the divine realm from the material plane. They believed that mortals should be free from the constant tug-of-war between gods and should have the chance to shape their own destiny.

The two deities gathered like-minded gods to form what would be called The Grey, a coalition committed to enacting their vision. Together, they crafted a plan to shatter the world into multiple planes, each with its own purpose, and lock the gods away on the outer planes, restricting their direct influence on the material world.

When [[./The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] learned of this plan, they launched a final, desperate assault to stop the Grey. The resulting battle shook the foundations of existence. However, in the end, [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] was successful. [[./The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] were banished to the lower planes, imprisoned in realms of torment and chaos, while the Grey and their allies retreated to distant planes, still able to influence the material world, but no longer able to walk among mortals freely.

This event, known as [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], reshaped Verak’eal, scattering the gods across the planes and marking the end of the Age of Gods. The mortal world was left to rebuild, and while the gods still watch over the world, their power is now tempered by distance and restriction.

# Goals and Ideals
The Grey represents a balance between many focal points, and the understanding that power must be carefully managed. They believe in allowing mortals to live without the constant interference of gods, granting them the freedom to grow, learn, and make their own choices. While many of The Grey's members see themselves as a force of good, they do not see the role of The Grey as simply to vanquish evil. Instead, their mission is to preserve balance and prevent the gods from overwhelming mortal affairs.

Some of their guiding ideals include:
- **Containment of Divine Power**: The Grey recognizes that even well-meaning gods can cause immense harm if their power is left unchecked. [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] was meant to ensure that divine influence is limited.
- **Protection of Mortals**: Though they are bound to the outer planes, the Grey still seek to protect the mortal realm from threats, both divine and mortal.
- **Balance**: The Grey opposes both rampant chaos and oppressive order, striving for a balanced approach that respects the autonomy of the mortal world.
- **Redemption and Progress**: Gods such as [[./The Grey/Dathin|Dathin]] and [[./The Grey/Sheleth|Sheleth]] believe in the potential for redemption and creativity in all beings, mortal or divine.

# The Shatter
[[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] was the defining event of the Grey’s formation and purpose. It is a constant reminder of the dangers of unchecked divine power, and its aftermath continues to shape the relationship between the gods and mortals of Verak’eal. While the Grey succeeded in their mission, [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] was not perfect, and many divine beings still struggle against their restraints, influencing the world in subtle ways through visions, omens, and their devoted followers.

[[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] fractured the once-whole realm into multiple planes, each serving a different purpose, with the material plane at the centre. Mortals now navigate a world where gods are distant but not entirely gone, and The Grey remains vigilant, ensuring that [[./The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] remain contained and that no god, not even themselves, ever gains too much power again.

# Worship
Followers of the Grey deities are diverse, ranging from priests and paladins to scholars and artisans. Worship varies based on the god, but all followers share a respect for the Grey’s mission to protect mortals from divine overreach. Temples dedicated to Grey deities often feature simple, balanced designs, symbolizing the careful balance of power that the gods seek to maintain.

Ceremonies often invoke [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] as a reminder of the gods’ sacrifice for the good of the world, and many rituals focus on maintaining the delicate harmony between order, chaos, and mortal freedom.
