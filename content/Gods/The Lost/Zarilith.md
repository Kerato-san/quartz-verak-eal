**Zarilith** is the **goddess of cruelty and drow**, a goddess who embodies corruption, ambition, and the twisted manipulation of destiny. Once a trusted companion of [[../The Grey/Sheleth|Sheleth]], the god of beauty, Zarilith desired greater control over elven destiny. Her greed led her to betray [[../The Grey/Sheleth|Sheleth]], and as punishment, she was cursed with a monstrous form, half-drow and half-centipede, and cast into the Underdark. Her followers, the drow, mirror her ambition and cruelty, thriving in a society where betrayal is a path to power.

# Description
Zarilith appears as a striking and terrifying figure. Her upper half is the image of dark elven beauty, with smooth black-blue skin, white hair cascading like silk, and eyes of molten amber. Her lower body, however, is that of a massive centipede, with hundreds of legs that writhe and click against the stone floors of her realm. This monstrous form symbolises the corruption that has overtaken her once noble nature. Her eyes, piercing and glowing, are said to see through any deception, except her own.

In some depictions, venom drips from her lips, and her voice is said to be a honeyed poison, weaving lies and ambition into the minds of her followers. Around her, shadows move unnaturally, as if alive with her will.

# Personality
Zarilith is a being of boundless ambition and cruelty. Once concerned with guiding elven destiny, she now seeks to control and corrupt it. She teaches her followers to embrace deception and manipulation, claiming that the true path to power is through betrayal and ambition. Her philosophy is simple: those who can take power deserve it, and those who are weak are nothing more than stepping stones on the path to greatness.

While Zarilith can be charming and persuasive, her motives are always self-serving. She delights in watching her followers betray one another, encouraging a society where ambition reigns supreme. However, she is not without a twisted sense of loyalty to her drow followers, whom she views as her greatest creations. Under Zarilith’s influence, the drow have become a race of cunning, ruthless beings, perfectly suited to survive in the treacherous depths of the Underdark.

# Relationships
Zarilith was once a trusted ally of [[../The Grey/Sheleth|Sheleth]] (god of beauty), but her hunger for control over elven destiny led to her betrayal. When [[../The Grey/Sheleth|Sheleth]] discovered her seduction of the elves, corrupting their beauty and grace into something twisted, he cursed her, transforming her lower body into that of a monstrous centipede and banishing her to the Underdark. This act marked the beginning of the drow’s fall from grace.

Among the gods of [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], Zarilith is a key figure. She fought alongside [[./Fax|Fax]] (god of domination) and [[./Pentath|Pentath]] (god of destruction) during [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], believing that chaos and betrayal would give her greater control over destiny. While she has allies among [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], even they do not fully trust her, for Zarilith’s ambition has no bounds, and she would betray anyone if it meant advancing her goals.

# Worshippers
Zarilith’s worshippers are primarily the drow, who revere her as their dark matron and queen. Her teachings of ambition, betrayal, and power-through-deceit are the foundation of drow society. Within their underground cities, power struggles and assassinations are common, as every drow vies for Zarilith’s favour. Her influence is seen in the drow’s ruthless political structure, where only the most cunning survive.

Her worshippers outside of the drow are typically those who seek to manipulate others for personal gain—assassins, corrupt leaders, and ambitious manipulators. Her temples are located deep within the Underdark, surrounded by mazes of stone and filled with symbols of betrayal and power. The drow believe that Zarilith rewards those who succeed in their schemes, blessing them with cunning and control over their enemies.

## Orders
- **The Venomous Brood**: An elite order of drow assassins who serve Zarilith by spreading her influence through poison and deception. They are masters of stealth and betrayal, often working as political tools for the noble houses of the Underdark, though their true loyalty is always to Zarilith.
- **The Shadowweavers**: A secretive group of drow clerics and nobles who guide their people through manipulation and ambition, using Zarilith’s teachings to control the destiny of the drow and the surface-dwellers alike. They act as Zarilith’s direct agents, ensuring that her will is carried out across Verak’eal.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Power is destiny, and destiny is ours to weave."
- "Betrayal is the path to greatness."
- "The shadows carry secrets, and secrets are the keys to power."

# History
Zarilith’s story is one of ambition, betrayal, and transformation. Once a goddess of elven destiny, she grew dissatisfied with the freedom [[../The Grey/Sheleth|Sheleth]] allowed the elves. Zarilith sought to impose her control, seducing elves to follow her, promising them power in exchange for loyalty. She slowly corrupted their beauty into something darker, something she believed was stronger.

When [[../The Grey/Sheleth|Sheleth]] discovered her treachery, he cursed Zarilith, transforming her into the half-drow, half-centipede form she now inhabits, and banished her to the Underdark. The elves who had followed her into the shadows were transformed by the Underdark into the drow, and Zarilith became their queen and patron deity. 

During [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], Zarilith fought alongside [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], seeking to use the chaos of war to seize control over the destiny of Verak’eal. Her cunning and ambition made her a formidable ally of [[./Fax|Fax]] and [[./Pentath|Pentath]], though even they kept a wary distance from her. Though [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] confined the gods’ influence, Zarilith’s hold over the drow remained strong, and she continues to shape their society from the shadows.

# Tenets of Faith
Her followers adhere to these commandments:
- It is better to be loved than feared, but you may certainly try to be both.
- Misdirection, slander, and shadowed steps have more function than direct conflict.
- Death to the elves who live under the sun. Death to all their allies!

# Prophets
- **Melira the Venomous**: A drow high priestess who led her people deeper into the Underdark, carving out a new city dedicated to Zarilith. Known for her mastery of poisons and intrigue, Melira is revered as one of Zarilith’s most loyal servants.
- **Aradros the Betrayer**: An elven prince who defected to Zarilith, leading a contingent of elves into the Underdark. His betrayal marked the beginning of the drow’s rise to power. Aradros is seen as a paragon of Zarilith’s teachings, a master of ambition and deceit.
