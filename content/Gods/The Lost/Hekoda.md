**Hekoda** is the god of hatred, destruction, and primal rage. He represents the raw, untamed power of hatred, a force that fuels the desire to dominate, conquer, and annihilate. His followers revel in destruction, seeing ruin and bloodshed as the only true paths to strength. To worship Hekoda is to embrace fury as the ultimate source of power and view mercy as the greatest weakness.

# Description
Hekoda manifests as a monstrous humanoid beast, towering over others with his elongated bull-like head, filled with jagged teeth that seem to snarl with constant rage. His massive, muscular body is covered in thick, dark fur, and his powerful arms end in large, razor-sharp claws. His blood-red eyes glow with primal hatred, and his very presence exudes an aura of fury and destruction. Hekoda’s mouth is often depicted in a vicious snarl, as if eternally on the verge of lashing out at those around him.

In art, Hekoda is often shown standing atop a mountain of corpses, his body drenched in blood, symbolizing his unrelenting rage and his belief that only the strongest survive.

# Personality
Hekoda is driven by unquenchable rage. He views hatred as the purest emotion, believing that only through hatred can one find the strength to destroy, conquer, and rule. Mercy, love, and empathy are weaknesses in his eyes, and those who show such emotions are fit only to be crushed beneath the feet of the strong. 

Hekoda’s interactions with his followers are often violent and brief, rewarding only those who demonstrate exceptional strength and rage. He encourages his followers to indulge their fury, ruin all who stand before them, and revel in the bloodshed. To Hekoda, the weak are a plague that must be purged from existence, leaving only those worthy of power behind.

# Relationships
Hekoda's allies are few, as his blind rage makes it difficult for him to form true partnerships. However, he shares a mutual respect with **Fax**, the god of domination. Both believe in the right of the strong to rule, though Hekoda values raw strength and rage while Fax prefers calculated control. **Pentath**, the god of destruction, is also a frequent ally, as both gods revel in the annihilation of all that stands before them.

Hekoda's hatred is boundless, and his enemies are many. **Serah**, the goddess of love, is his most hated adversary. He views her compassion and love as the ultimate weakness, and her very existence is an affront to his beliefs. **Nethin**, the goddess of secrets and trickery, is another target of Hekoda's fury, as her subtlety and deception infuriate him; he despises those who do not fight openly with raw power. Lastly, **Lindof**, the god of war and strength, is loathed by Hekoda for representing the honour and discipline in battle, ideals that Hekoda sees as restraints on true power.

# Worshippers
Hekoda’s followers are savage, violent, and driven by an insatiable thirst for destruction. They are often found in barbarian tribes, raiding parties, and warbands, tearing through civilisations with no mercy. They believe in survival of the fittest, and any show of weakness is met with brutal execution. Hekoda’s worshippers revel in bloodshed, believing that only through total ruin and primal fury can true strength be achieved.

His temples are not places of peace or quiet worship. Instead, they are blood-soaked arenas where the strongest fight to the death to prove their worth. The screams of the dying are considered prayers to Hekoda, and the more violent the sacrifice, the more pleased he becomes.

## Orders
- **The Bloodclaws**: A brutal group of berserkers who dedicate their lives to the destruction of all who oppose them. They travel the lands, razing cities and leaving nothing but chaos in their wake, believing that each conquest brings them closer to Hekoda's favour.
- **The Purging Legion**: A warband of fanatics who seek to "cleanse" the world of the weak. Their members take oaths to never show mercy, and they believe that Hekoda's wrath will one day engulf the entire realm, leaving only the strongest standing.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Fury is power, and power is the only truth."
- "The weak exist to be purged; the strong to conquer."
- "There is no peace, only blood."

# History
**Hekoda’s Role in the Age of Gods**  
Hekoda’s rise to power came during the most violent eras of the **Age of Gods**, when war and bloodshed swept across the planes. He thrived in the chaos, feeding off the hatred of mortals and gods alike, and gaining strength from every act of violence. His teachings of survival through destruction spread quickly, especially among barbarian tribes and warmongers.

**Hekoda and the Shatter**  
During the **Shatter**, Hekoda fought fiercely alongside the **Lost**, seeing the war as an opportunity to purge the weak and reshape the planes into a realm of endless destruction. He led his most brutal followers into battle, leaving ruin in their wake. Despite the defeat of the Lost, Hekoda's rage never subsided, and his followers continue to seek power through conquest, awaiting the day when they can rise again and spread his fury across the world.

# Tenets of Faith
Hekoda’s followers adhere to these commandments:
- Ruin. Conquer. Kill.
- The weak exist to be crushed by the strong. Be the strong.
- There are no emotions but fury and joy. The rest are weakness.

# Prophets
- **Gorn the Ravager**: A warlord who claimed to have been chosen by Hekoda to bring about a new age of destruction. Gorn’s conquests were marked by unrelenting brutality, and his reign of terror spread fear across the lands before his eventual death in battle, which his followers viewed as the ultimate honour.
- **Vasha Bloodfang**: A barbarian queen who led her tribe to victory in countless battles, attributing her success to Hekoda’s favour. Vasha believed that by spilling enough blood, she could one day ascend to become Hekoda's right hand in the afterlife.
