**Namiut** is the goddess of evil dragons, conquest, and greed. Once a counterpart to Mahatu, the god of good dragons, she forsook the balance they once shared, choosing instead to indulge in her lust for power and dominance. She embodies the malevolent side of dragonkind, delighting in tyranny, hoarding wealth, and subjugating those weaker than herself. Her followers, especially chromatic and gem dragons, pursue wealth and power with unrelenting cruelty.

# Description
Namiut can take on the form of any non-metallic dragon, giving her a vast array of appearances depending on her whims or the situation at hand. Often depicted as a massive dragon with ever-shifting scales of chromatic colours, red, black, green, blue, and white, or even the shimmering facets of a gem dragon, her presence is an overwhelming embodiment of pride and power. Her eyes glow with a fierce hunger for dominance, and her wings are said to blot out the sky when fully spread.

In her humanoid form, she is often portrayed as a regal yet terrifying figure, draped in luxurious robes adorned with gold and precious gems, a symbol of her greed and dominance.

# Personality
Namiut is proud, vain, and ruthless. She believes in the absolute right of the strong to rule the weak, and views those without the will to defend their wealth or power as undeserving of either. Her disdain for weakness is profound, and she has no tolerance for those who show mercy or compassion. 

Namiut is highly calculating, always seeking new ways to expand her hoard, whether through conquest, manipulation, or raw force. She views mortals and even lesser gods as tools to be used and discarded, and her sense of justice is skewed entirely toward her own interests. However, despite her cruelty, she is not reckless—Namiut prefers to plot and bide her time, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

# Relationships
Namiut once stood as an equal to **Mahatu**, god of good dragons, before their divergence. Where Mahatu saw the role of dragons as protectors, Namiut viewed them as conquerors, born to rule over the lesser beings of the world. The schism between them is a defining part of Namiut’s identity, as she feels that Mahatu betrayed his true nature by siding with the weak. Now, the two deities are bitter enemies, locked in eternal opposition.

Namiut has a strong alliance with **Fax**, god of domination, as their ideologies of power and control closely align. Both gods seek to subjugate and rule, though Namiut’s ambitions focus more on hoarding wealth and ruling over her draconic kin. She also shares a bond with **Wendel**, the god of greed, who appreciates her mastery of amassing wealth and treasures, though their alliance is tinged with mutual distrust, as each constantly seeks to out-hoard the other.

Her hatred is most profound toward **Serah**, goddess of love, whose ideals of compassion and care stand in stark contrast to Namiut’s values. She also despises **Nethin**, the goddess of secrets and trickery, whose deceptions and illusions irritate Namiut’s desire for open, brutal domination. However, of all her enemies, **Mahatu** remains the one she loathes most deeply, as his very existence is a reminder of what she once was and the balance she rejected.

# Worshippers
Namiut’s worshippers are among the most powerful and malevolent beings in Verak’eal. Chief among them are evil dragons—especially chromatic dragons—who revel in their goddess’s call to hoard wealth, crush the weak, and amass power. These dragons, along with their mortal servants, spread her doctrine of conquest and tyranny wherever they fly. Tyrants, conquerors, and rulers who seek to expand their empires through force and fear also call upon Namiut, hoping to gain her favour and increase their dominion.

Namiut’s temples are dark, opulent places filled with gold, treasure, and the bones of her enemies. Her priests wear robes adorned with gold and jewels, leading their followers in rituals that often involve sacrifices to demonstrate strength and dominance. These temples often lie deep within the domains of chromatic dragons or other powerful creatures, guarded fiercely by those who serve her.

## Orders
- **The Claws of Conquest**: A group of Namiut’s most devoted followers, they are tasked with spreading her rule through conquest and subjugation. These warriors and clerics wield brutal power, crushing any who stand in their way, leaving destruction and hoarded wealth in their wake.
- **The Draconic Host**: A secretive group of dragon-worshippers who act as intermediaries between evil dragons and mortal warlords. They spread Namiut’s influence by offering their services as advisors and spies, helping rulers secure power through deceit and betrayal.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Power is meant to be taken, not given."
- "The weak exist to serve the strong."
- "Let no affront go unpunished, and let no treasure go unclaimed."

# History
**The Creation of Dragons**  
Namiut and Mahatu were once the dual forces of draconic creation, embodying the elemental power of dragons. Together, they ruled with balance, neither good nor evil, until life began to blossom across Verak’eal. As mortals emerged, Mahatu saw them as fragile beings in need of protection, while Namiut saw them as tools to be controlled and exploited. This ideological split led to their eventual separation, with Namiut embracing the path of evil and becoming the goddess of chromatic dragons.

**The Betrayal**  
Namiut’s betrayal was swift and ruthless. She sought to corrupt dragons, turning them into malevolent forces of destruction. Her greed and ambition drove her to seek domination over all, believing that those who could not defend themselves were not worthy of existence. Namiut’s corruption led many dragons to follow her, birthing the chromatic dragons and creating a lasting rift between her and Mahatu, whose metallic dragons opposed her.

**Role in the Shatter**  
During the **Shatter**, Namiut fought fiercely on the side of The Lost, using her chromatic dragons to sow chaos and destruction across the realms. She believed the Shatter was her opportunity to seize ultimate power, but despite her efforts, The Lost were ultimately defeated. Though the Shatter failed to bring about her domination, Namiut has not given up, and she continues to plot from the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike again.

# Tenets of Faith
Her followers follow these commandments:
- Amass wealth, and spend little. The gold, and the power that comes with it, is sufficient reward.
- Do not forgive nor forget an indignity to yourself. Let no affront go unpunished.
- Take what you covet. Those without the strength to defend their dominion are not worthy to have a dominion.

# Prophets
- **Sarkath the Hoarder**: A red dragon who was one of Namiut’s most powerful followers. Sarkath amassed a vast treasure hoard during his lifetime, laying waste to kingdoms in his search for wealth and power. His legacy lives on in the stories told by Namiut’s faithful, who strive to emulate his greed and ferocity.
- **Drava the Ruthless**: A mortal warlord who conquered vast territories in Namiut’s name, Drava’s reign was marked by cruelty and tyranny. She believed that by claiming enough land and wealth, she would ascend to become a dragon in the afterlife, an honour she sought with relentless ambition.
