**Wendel** is the **god of greed**. Though he owns immense wealth, it is never enough for him. He finds no joy in possessing things, but in the act of obtaining them. His desire to hoard all forms of wealth makes him a feared and respected god among those who follow him.

# Description
Wendel is often depicted as an imposing figure, his skin shimmering with the lustre of pure gold, and his face locked in an eternal, unsettling grin. His mouth is filled with sharp, gem-like teeth that glisten with a deadly sparkle. His eyes, pools of liquid silver, reflect nothing but an emotionless, dead gaze that never blinks or shifts, always observing but never revealing his true intentions. The Gilded One's smile never falters, a testament to his joy in accumulating wealth through the suffering or downfall of others.

His form is often accompanied by **Ge'dzel**, a sleek, silver serpent. She's typically coiled around his shoulders or arm. A lesser deity in her own right, Ge'dzel serves Wendel with absolute loyalty, rumoured to have been stolen or liberated from another god long ago. Her bite can turn mortals into statues of solid silver, preserving them in their final moments of greed or fear. But more fearsome still is her hypnotic gaze, which can incite an uncontrollable greed in any who meet her eyes, driving them to madness in their desire for wealth.

His appearance, though rich and magnificent, carries an unsettling aura that unnerves even his most loyal followers. Whether in his golden splendour or surrounded by vast vaults of treasure, Wendel is a deity of cold ambition, with no warmth behind his grin or silvered eyes.

# Personality
Wendel is a being driven entirely by greed. He is calculating, always seeking ways to increase his wealth and influence. His mind is ever focused on profit, and he cares little for the morality of his methods. To him, wealth is power, and those without it are weak and undeserving. While he may offer deals to those who seek his favour, his gifts always come with a hidden price.

Wendel despises waste and idleness and respects those who share his ambition for wealth, though he always ensures that he has the upper hand in any alliance.

# Relationships
One of Wendel's most unique relationships is with Ge'dzel, his lesser deity companion. Legends tell that Ge'dzel was either stolen or liberated by Wendel from another god, and she has since sworn fealty to him. Ge'dzel is a silver serpent with a hypnotic gaze that incites greed and a bite that turns mortals into solid silver. She is both a trusted ally and a weapon in Wendel’s arsenal, embodying the very essence of greed and serving as an extension of his will.

Wendel's hunger for wealth has earned him both allies and enemies. He shares a strong friendship with [[./Namiut|Namiut]], the goddess of evil dragons, as they both covet power and treasure. Wendel also favours [[./Fax|Fax]], the god of domination, as their goals of subjugation and control often align.

However, Wendel holds a deep disdain for [[../The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]], the god of law, as laws restrict his ability to gain wealth through manipulation and deceit. He also despises [[../The Grey/Rindra|Rindra]], the goddess of knowledge, for her insistence on transparency and truth, which stands in direct opposition to his secretive methods of wealth accumulation. Lastly, he harbours an intense rivalry with [[../The Grey/Mahatu|Mahatu]], the god of good dragons, who protects the treasures Wendel covets most.

# Worshippers
Wendel's followers are those who seek wealth and power above all else. Merchants, thieves, and even nobles pray to Wendel for guidance in their dealings, hoping to amass fortunes under his watchful eye. His temples are often hidden behind the façades of banks or guild halls, where deals are struck in secret, and fortunes change hands. His clerics teach that the world belongs to those who take it, and they bless any venture that promises profit, no matter how ruthless.

## Orders
- **The Gilded Fist**: A secretive order of merchants, nobles, and thieves who serve as Wendel's elite followers. They manipulate markets, topple empires, and seize power, all in Wendel’s name.
- **Order of the Silver Serpent**: A group of assassins and thieves who carry out covert operations to accumulate wealth and eliminate Wendel’s enemies.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Wealth is power, and power is all that matters."
- "The world belongs to those who take it."
- "Greed is the engine that drives all progress."

# History
Before [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], Wendel’s greed was unmatched. He accumulated wealth in all forms, gold, artefacts, land, through any means necessary. However, during [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], his hoarded treasures were scattered across the planes. Despite this setback, Wendel continued to influence mortals, teaching them the ways of greed and accumulation.

During [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], Wendel supported [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] in hopes of gaining even more power. Though they ultimately lost the war, Wendel's teachings of greed and ambition persisted, and his influence remains strong in the mortal world.

# Tenets of Faith
Wendel's followers adhere to these core principles:
- Acquire wealth and power wherever you can.
- Take what you can; those without the strength to hold their possessions are unworthy of keeping them.
- Guard your wealth carefully, for others will covet it as much as you do.

# Prophets
- **Galor the Golden**: A powerful merchant lord who rose from nothing by following Wendel’s teachings. He amassed a fortune through cunning business deals, often at the expense of his competitors, and became a symbol of Wendel’s favour.
- **Jalia the Silvered**: A merchant who claimed Wendel blessed her with a silver tongue. She manipulated entire kingdoms with her cunning, amassing riches and power until her mysterious disappearance.
