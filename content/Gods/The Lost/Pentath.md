**Pentath** is the malevolent **god of destruction**. A deity of relentless obliteration, Pentath seeks to return all creation to a state of nothingness. His followers believe that the destruction of the world is not only inevitable but should be hastened, to prepare for the **Epoch of Ends**, a prophecy foretelling the total collapse of reality at Pentath’s hands. To serve him is to embrace annihilation, rejecting any notion of creation or preservation. Where Pentath's influence spreads, nothing is left unscathed.

# Description  
Pentath is often depicted as a massive, terrifying figure wreathed in swirling flames and smoke. His body is made of shifting, crumbling stone, continually collapsing and reforming. His eyes burn with the intensity of a dying star, and his limbs are cracked and jagged like the remnants of a once-great monument. He carries a massive maul or a flaming sword, both symbols of his desire to smash all things into oblivion. Wherever he walks, the ground cracks and shatters beneath him, and the air becomes thick with ash.

# Personality  
Pentath is a god of pure, unrelenting destruction. He finds bliss in the collapse of everything, seeing the beauty in chaos and ruin. His rage is boundless, and his desires are simple: to reduce all things to dust and ash. To Pentath, creation is inherently flawed, and the only path to true purity is through absolute annihilation. His followers and enemies alike are mere tools or obstacles in the inevitable end. Unlike other gods who seek power or dominion, Pentath cares only for the obliteration of all that exists.

He despises order, civilisation, and anything that represents stability or permanence. While he harbours a particular hatred for the gods of creation, law, and protection, Pentath’s enmity extends to any being that seeks to preserve or protect the world.

# Relationships  
Pentath is reviled by most of the gods, both among [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] and [[../The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]]. His absolute desire for destruction leaves little room for alliances, though he does form temporary partnerships with gods whose goals align with his, albeit briefly. He shares a tenuous relationship with [[./Fax|Fax]], the god of domination, as both seek to subjugate the world—though Pentath ultimately wishes to destroy everything, including [[./Fax|Fax]]’s dominion.

[[./Namiut|Namiut]], the goddess of evil dragons, is an ally by convenience, as they both revel in the destructive nature of their followers. However, even she treads carefully around Pentath, knowing that his appetite for ruin may turn on her one day. Pentath also respects [[./Nethira|Nethira]], the goddess of deceit, who uses subterfuge and manipulation to tear apart societies from within, hastening their collapse.

Among the gods of [[../The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]], Pentath’s most bitter rival is [[../The Grey/Varida|Varida]], the Stone Mother, whose worshippers revere creation and craft. Her efforts to build and preserve are the antithesis of Pentath’s destructive nature, and their clashes often leave devastation in their wake. [[../The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]], the god of law, also opposes Pentath with every fibre of his being, as Pentath represents the ultimate breakdown of order and civilisation. [[../The Grey/Sheleth|Sheleth]], the god of art, also stands in opposition, as Pentath’s wrath targets the very beauty and creativity that [[../The Grey/Sheleth|Sheleth]] cherishes.

# Worshippers  
Pentath’s worshippers are those who crave the end of all things. His followers include nihilists who believe that nothing matters except destruction, warlords who seek to crush their enemies, and anarchists who desire the collapse of civilisation. Cults devoted to Pentath often operate in secret, sowing chaos and ruin wherever they go. These cults embrace a destructive philosophy, burning cities, toppling kingdoms, and bringing devastation in their wake. 

His priests teach that life, art, and order are transient illusions, and the only true constant is the eventual collapse of everything. They revel in destruction, whether by setting cities ablaze, unleashing terrible magic, or toppling governments. Rituals to Pentath often involve the sacrifice of valuable structures or symbols of civilisation, offered up to hasten the arrival of the Epoch of Ends.

## Orders  
- **The Ruined Hand**: A fanatical cult dedicated to the complete destruction of society. They believe that only by tearing down the pillars of civilisation can they prepare for Pentath’s final triumph.
- **Ashen Blades**: A band of warlords and marauders who follow Pentath’s doctrine of total destruction. They leave nothing but scorched earth and collapsed cities in their wake, believing that through ruin, they honour their god.

## Favoured Sayings  
- "In the ashes, all are equal."  
- "Only in destruction can true freedom be found."  
- "Everything built is destined to fall."

# History  
Pentath’s role in the Age of Gods was one of sheer devastation. He played a pivotal role in the divine wars, bringing ruin to both mortal and divine realms alike. During [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], Pentath fought alongside [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], seeking to tear down the fabric of reality itself. His rampages during the war left entire planes shattered and broken, their remnants still littered with the scars of his fury. Though [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] were ultimately defeated, Pentath’s influence remains potent, as his followers continue to wreak havoc across Verak’eal.

Some of his most fanatical followers believe that Pentath’s imprisonment within the Abyssal Void is only temporary, and that when he escapes, the Epoch of Ends will begin. This apocalyptic prophecy speaks of a time when Pentath will destroy not only the world of Verak’eal, but the very planes of existence, leaving nothing but void in his wake.

# Tenets of Faith  
His followers adhere to these commandments:  
- Everything will be destroyed in time. If you are forced to hurry the process along, never regret doing so.  
- Only build something to destroy something else.  
- Ruin and raze the realms to prepare for the Epoch of Ends.

# Prophets  
- **Krex the Ruiner**: A once-great warlord who devoted himself to Pentath after witnessing the destruction of his kingdom. Krex became a figure of terror, razing entire cities in Pentath’s name.  
- **The Ash Prophet**: A madman who claimed to have seen the coming of the Epoch of Ends. He led a group of Pentathian fanatics in an assault on a major city, burning it to the ground in an effort to bring about the prophecy.
