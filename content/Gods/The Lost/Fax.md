**Fax** is the god of domination and control, a deity whose followers seek to impose their will on others, enslaving and subjugating those weaker than themselves. He represents the harshest aspects of order, where strength is used not to uplift but to suppress, and power is held in iron-fisted tyranny.

# Description
Fax is often depicted as a massive, imposing figure draped in heavy armour adorned with chains and spikes. His face is usually hidden beneath a helmet, though when revealed, his eyes burn with cold malice, and his expression is one of grim authority. His presence is suffocating, with an aura that makes even the strongest feel powerless in his gaze. He is frequently shown holding a spiked chain, which he uses both as a weapon and a symbol of his unyielding grip over those under his command.

# Personality
Fax is a cold and calculating deity, valuing order and control above all else. He sees mercy as a weakness and believes that the strong must rule over the weak with absolute authority. Compassion, in his eyes, is a betrayal of power, and those who show it are undeserving of their strength. His followers are expected to dominate and enslave others, and any rebellion against their rule must be crushed swiftly and ruthlessly. Fax is not one for emotional outbursts or irrational cruelty; his tyranny is efficient, methodical, and born from a belief that it is the natural order of things.

# Relationships
Fax has few true allies, as his nature makes cooperation difficult. However, he shares a mutual respect with **Pentath**, the god of destruction, as both believe in using power to reshape the world in their image, albeit through different means. **Namiut**, the goddess of evil dragons, is another ally, as her worshippers often serve as enforcers of tyranny under Fax’s banner, their raw strength complementing his cold intellect.

On the opposing side, Fax holds a deep enmity towards **Timnar**, the god of law. While both value order, Timnar’s pursuit of justice and fairness is diametrically opposed to Fax’s belief that law exists to empower the strong at the expense of the weak. **Sheleth**, god of art and beauty, is another enemy, as the freedom of expression and individual creativity that Sheleth embodies stands in stark contrast to the oppressive control that Fax enforces.

Fax also despises **Rindra**, goddess of knowledge, whose efforts to educate and empower mortals undermine his doctrine of keeping the masses ignorant and subservient. Knowledge, in Fax’s eyes, is a tool of control, and allowing it to be freely shared weakens the chains of domination that bind the world.

# Worshippers
Fax’s followers are the cruelest rulers, slavers, and dictators, those who seek to bend others to their will and crush rebellion before it can begin. His worshippers are often found in the highest echelons of oppressive regimes, where they enforce strict hierarchies and use fear to maintain control. His temples resemble fortresses, filled with torture chambers, training grounds for enforcers, and monuments to strength and power.

In these temples, rituals are often centred around displays of dominance, where the weak are forced to submit publicly to the strong. These rituals reinforce the hierarchy that Fax demands, ensuring that no one forgets their place in the order of things.

## Orders
- **The Chains of Command**: An elite group of enforcers and slavers who carry out Fax’s will, subjugating entire populations and ensuring that rebellion is snuffed out before it can take root.
- **The Iron Gauntlet**: A militaristic order that trains tyrants and warlords, teaching them how to maintain control through fear, oppression, and ruthless efficiency.

## Favoured Sayings
- "Power is your right; take it, or it will be taken from you."
- "Mercy is the refuge of the weak."
- "Only through submission can true strength be revealed."

# History
**Fax’s Role in the Age of Gods**  
Fax rose to prominence during the **Age of Gods**, when mortals first began to organise into hierarchies of power. It was Fax who taught kings and emperors how to bend their subjects to their will, how to maintain control through fear, and how to crush rebellion before it could begin. His influence spread quickly among the ambitious and the cruel, and his teachings became the backbone of many tyrannical regimes.

**Fax and the Shatter**  
During the **Shatter**, Fax fought alongside the **Lost**, seeking to use the chaos of the conflict to spread his doctrine of domination. While other gods sought freedom or justice, Fax saw an opportunity to impose a new world order, where his iron rule would stretch across the planes. Though the **Grey** ultimately succeeded, Fax’s influence did not wane. His followers continued to spread his teachings, and in the aftermath of the Shatter, many sought to rebuild their power, hoping to one day see their god rise again.

# Tenets of Faith
Fax’s followers adhere to these commandments:
- Assert dominance and power over others. Show your strength of will in the image of the Lord.
- Repay cruelty done unto you with further evil. If others show you kindness, exploit it.
- As you ascend to power, do not pity or show mercy to those you climb over to get there. Compassion is unwarranted for the weak.

# Prophets
- **Darius the Iron Lord**: A warlord who claimed to have been visited by Fax in a dream. Under Fax’s guidance, he built an empire through cruelty and domination, his reign marked by brutality and the absolute subjugation of his people.
- **Thala the Chainbreaker**: A former slave who became one of Fax’s greatest champions. After rising to power through violent rebellion, she used her newfound strength to enslave those who had once been her captors, enforcing Fax’s belief that only the strong are fit to rule.
