**Xiloth** is **the goddess of pain**, feared for her unmatched cruelty and obsession with pain. Her followers revel in the suffering of others and themselves, considering agony to be the ultimate offering to their goddess. Xiloth represents the darkest, most primal aspects of existence, where pain is both power and pleasure.

# Description
Xiloth is often depicted as a fearsome yet eerily beautiful figure, her four horns arching from her skull in a wicked display of power. She possesses two sets of arms, each ending in razor-sharp claws capable of rending flesh and soul alike. Her haunting purple eyes glow with malice, and her smile holds a twisted allure. Xiloth’s body is adorned with the scars of her victims, etched into her flesh as a testament to the countless lives she has tormented.

 She is typically depicted holding tools of torture, bloodstained whips, chains, and knives, symbols of the endless agony she brings. Her presence is overwhelming, filling the air with the stench of blood and the screams of the damned.

# Personality
Xiloth is driven by an insatiable lust for suffering. She seeks out torment in all its forms, finding bliss in the screams of her victims and the sight of broken wills. Whether through slow, agonising torture or swift, brutal violence, she takes pleasure in the destruction of body and spirit alike. Unlike other deities who seek power, knowledge, or dominion, Xiloth desires only the anguish of others.

For Xiloth, pain is an art form, and she considers herself its master artist. She sees the human mind as a delicate canvas—each flicker of despair, every scream, a brushstroke of her masterpiece. A broken bone is satisfying, but a crushed soul is transcendent. She revels in crafting situations where her victims are not only physically tortured but are also mentally stripped of hope, dignity, and the will to fight.

Her cruelty knows no bounds, but she values loyalty among her followers, particularly those who prove their devotion through acts of extreme brutality. However, Xiloth’s gaze is fickle, and her favour is fleeting. Many who worship her too closely find themselves the subjects of her torment.

Despite her obsession with torment, Xiloth is also calculated, using her grasp over pain to manipulate others into submission. Her interactions with mortals are rare, but those who have encountered her power speak of an overwhelming aura of dread and despair, as if the very presence of the goddess could break their will.

# Relationships
Xiloth’s cruelty isolates her from many deities, but she finds kinship with a select few. She has a particular fondness for [[./Zarilith|Zarilith]], goddess of deception and darkness, whose manipulation and betrayal pair well with Xiloth’s love for suffering. Together, their schemes have caused untold misery, weaving webs of deceit and pain across the realms.

[[./Nethira|Nethira]], goddess of deceit, also aligns well with Xiloth, as both revel in the manipulation of minds and the infliction of slow, drawn-out suffering. Their followers sometimes collaborate, blending psychological torment with physical pain to break even the strongest wills.

However, Xiloth holds enmity toward [[../The Grey/Serah|Serah]], the goddess of love, whose compassion and care are antithetical to her own dark desires. Xiloth despises any force that seeks to alleviate pain or bring comfort to the suffering. Similarly, she harbours hatred for [[../The Grey/Lindof|Lindof]], the god of war and strength, whose followers often resist pain and hardship in battle, something Xiloth views as a challenge to her dominion.

Xiloth holds [[./Pentath|Pentath]], the god of destruction, in high regard, for where he leaves ruin in his wake, she follows to revel in the aftermath. The destruction he brings offers her countless opportunities to inflict torment on the survivors of his chaos.

# Worshippers
Xiloth’s followers are fanatical in their dedication, seeking out ways to cause pain wherever they go. Torturers, sadists, and those who take pleasure in the suffering of others form the core of her worshippers, often engaging in rituals that involve self-mutilation or the torture of captives. Many of her temples are hidden away in dark places where only the most devout can enter, places where screams of agony serve as prayers to the goddess. Xiloth's priests are skilled in both the arts of inflicting and enduring pain, using their knowledge to keep their followers in line and enforce the goddess’s will.

## Orders
- **The Ravagers**: A militant order dedicated to spreading pain and suffering across the lands. They act as Xiloth’s enforcers, waging wars of terror and leaving devastation in their wake.
- **The Crimson Mask**: A secretive cult of torturers who believe that through pain, they can glimpse true enlightenment. They operate in hidden sanctuaries, offering sacrifices to Xiloth and studying the limits of mortal endurance.

## Favoured Sayings
- "In suffering, we find our purpose."
- "Pain is the only true power."
- "Through torment, we honour the Mistress."

# History
Xiloth was once a being of lesser power, feeding on the fear and agony of the mortal realm. However, as chaos erupted during the **Shatter**, she rose in power, drawing strength from the suffering caused by the wars between gods and mortals. She joined the ranks of **[[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]]**, eagerly embracing the opportunity to spread even greater pain and destruction. 

She was known to capture both gods and mortals alike, torturing them until their will broke and they swore allegiance to [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]]. Her role in the divine conflict was that of a ruthless interrogator, extracting secrets and sowing fear. During [[../../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], Xiloth led armies of sadistic followers, leaving entire cities in ruins, their inhabitants left to suffer in unspeakable torment. Though [[../The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] were defeated, Xiloth’s influence did not fade, and she remains a constant threat to the mortal realms.

# Tenets of Faith
Xiloth’s followers adhere to these tenets:
- Seek and exalt places where no light touches.
- Revel in the pain you inflict upon others, and relish the pain you suffer yourself as an offering to the Xiloth.
- Imprison those who cannot resist you, and drag all life into the darkness.

# Prophets
- **Morvak the Flayer**: A legendary torturer who claimed to be guided by Xiloth herself. His gruesome methods were feared across the land, and his legacy lives on in the brutal techniques he devised.
- **Zethra the Tormented**: A priestess who endured unimaginable suffering in Xiloth's name, claiming that through her pain, she had received divine visions of the end of all things. Her writings are considered sacred texts by Xiloth’s followers.
- **Vellara the Razor**: A sadistic cultist known for her expertise in both physical and emotional pain. She is said to have broken entire kingdoms with nothing but words and the careful application of Xiloth's dark blessings.
