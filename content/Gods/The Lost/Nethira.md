**Nethira** is the enigmatic and feared **goddess of deceit**. Her entire being is shrouded in secrecy, and legends surrounding her are often contradictory, feeding into the very chaos she sows. While her true form remains unknown, Nethira is said to be the master of lies, rising to power through webs of deceit and betrayal. Her followers are skilled in treachery, preferring cunning and slow, agonising torment to brute force. No one knows her true intentions, only that she thrives in the darkness of secrecy.

# Description  
Nethira’s appearance is a mystery to all, even her most devout followers. She is always depicted cloaked in shadows or veiled in such a way that no features are visible. Some say her true form is too horrifying to behold, while others whisper that she simply has no form and exists as an ever-shifting shadow. When she does manifest, it is often as a dark, whispering voice in the minds of those she manipulates. In rare visions, she appears as a figure enshrouded in veils and cloaks, moving as silently as the night itself, her presence chilling and unknowable.

# Personality  
Nethira embodies the essence of deceit, thriving on manipulation, shadows, and secrecy. She is patient, preferring long, drawn-out schemes rather than quick, overt acts. She finds joy in watching her plans unravel slowly, taking pleasure in the confusion and agony of her victims. Nethira’s ultimate goals are unknown, as she crafts lies within lies, making it nearly impossible for anyone, mortal or divine, to uncover her true motives. Her hatred for her supposed twin, [[../The Grey/Nethin|Nethin]], stems from the fact that while [[../The Grey/Nethin|Nethin]] uses trickery to reveal hidden truths, Nethira uses deception to bury them. 

She revels in the notion that truth is a weapon, and in her hands, it is twisted, inverted, and made into something poisonous. While many gods have desires for power, dominion, or protection, Nethira seems only to care for one thing: the control and destruction of her enemies through intricate deceit.

# Relationships  
Nethira is universally feared and distrusted, even among the Lost. Her alliances, when they exist, are always fragile and full of hidden agendas. She despises [[../The Grey/Nethin|Nethin]], her supposed twin, for [[../The Grey/Nethin|Nethin]]’s use of trickery to reveal rather than obscure. The two goddesses have been locked in a cold war of manipulation and subterfuge for ages, with each attempting to undo the other’s plans. Nethira’s hatred of [[../The Grey/Nethin|Nethin]] is matched only by her contempt for the Grey Pantheon as a whole, particularly [[../The Grey/Rindra|Rindra]], the goddess of knowledge, whose pursuit of truth stands in direct opposition to Nethira’s desire to keep truths hidden and distorted.

Nethira has found allies in the likes of [[./Zarilith|Zarilith]], the centipede queen and matron of the drow, and [[./Namiut|Namiut]], the goddess of evil dragons, both of whom share her love for domination and betrayal. Together, they plot to destabilise the Grey and spread their influence through covert means. Nethira’s relationship with [[./Fax|Fax]], the god of domination, is one of convenience, as she often provides him with the subtle manipulations necessary for his conquests. However, even he cannot fully trust her.

Despite her alliances, Nethira is a solitary figure, weaving plots that are often hidden even from her closest allies. Her only true loyalty is to herself and the darkness she represents.

# Worshippers  
Nethira’s followers are often those who operate in the shadows—assassins, spies, and manipulators who value subtlety and deception over brute force. They seek her guidance in crafting intricate schemes and using manipulation to achieve their goals. Her worshippers are scattered throughout Verak’eal, often posing as innocuous members of society while secretly working toward their own dark purposes. Her temples are hidden, often veiled behind layers of secrecy or located deep within enemy territories, making them nearly impossible to find unless one is initiated into her service.

Her priests are adept at using poison, shadow magic, and psychological torment to break their enemies, believing that a quick death is a mercy too great for those who oppose them. Rituals in her name are often carried out in darkness, with her followers swearing oaths of secrecy and vengeance as they offer sacrifices to the veiled goddess.

## Orders  
- **The Shadowed Blades**: An elite group of assassins who carry out Nethira’s will in the mortal realm, they specialise in eliminating enemies through subtle, undetectable means, often staging deaths to look like accidents or the work of others.  
- **The Eyes of the Veil**: This network of spies operates across multiple planes, gathering intelligence for Nethira’s followers. Their members are trained to extract secrets through deception, infiltration, and blackmail, often controlling the flow of information to mislead their targets.
- **The Poisoned Tongue**: Experts in persuasion and psychological warfare, the Poisoned Tongue use their mastery of manipulation to plant seeds of doubt and ruin reputations. Their agents are highly skilled diplomats, able to turn even the closest friends into enemies through well-placed lies and insinuations.

## Favoured Sayings  
- "In the dark, even the truth can become a weapon."  
- "A blade in the back is the only honest strike."  
- "Secrets are the foundation of power, for the one who knows all cannot be defeated."  

# History  
Nethira’s origins are shrouded in mystery, fitting for the goddess of deceit. Some say she was once an aspect of [[../The Grey/Nethin|Nethin]], the goddess of secrets and trickery, who was split apart during the divine conflict that led to the Shatter. Others believe she is [[../The Grey/Nethin|Nethin]]’s twin, born from the same essence but corrupted by a desire for chaos and destruction. Regardless of her true origins, Nethira quickly rose to prominence among the Lost, using her unparalleled skill in manipulation and lies to turn allies against each other and sow discord.

During the Shatter, Nethira played a pivotal role in destabilising the Grey’s forces, whispering lies and half-truths that caused rifts among the gods. She worked behind the scenes, orchestrating betrayals and sabotaging plans, though her true motives remained hidden even from her closest allies. While the Lost were ultimately defeated, Nethira emerged unscathed, retreating into the shadows to continue her schemes. Many believe that she still operates in the world, manipulating events from behind the scenes, though her true purpose remains unknown.

# Tenets of Faith  
Her followers follow these commandments:  
- Keep your acts obfuscated and secret. Revealing your true self is weakness. The night is your greatest ally.  
- The best weapons are cunning plans and intricate deceptions. Mortal minds are predictable and easily manipulated.  
- Kill slowly. Agonizingly. Or worse, make them enjoy it.  

# Prophets  
- **Tirasa the Veiled**: A master assassin and one of Nethira’s most devout followers, Tirasa is said to have eliminated dozens of powerful figures without ever being seen. Her name is spoken in hushed whispers among those in power, as no one is certain when or where she will strike next.  
- **The Faceless One**: A legendary spy who is said to have infiltrated the highest levels of government and religious orders. Their true identity remains unknown, but they are believed to have been responsible for toppling entire kingdoms with nothing but whispers and lies.
