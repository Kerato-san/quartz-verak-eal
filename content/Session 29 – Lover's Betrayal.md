An hour away from the valley’s exit, Archimedes returns with crucial information. He reports spotting a camp positioned strategically at the saddle point between the valleys. His reconnaissance reveals that 16 individuals had departed the camp, heading in their direction, while 17 others remained inside.

Simultaneously, Asra observes 14 men and a suspicious shadowy area ahead. In anticipation of the impending conflict, Megan endows Aina with the temporary ability to breathe lightning, a formidable addition to their arsenal.

The skirmish begins almost immediately as they engage the enemy. Suhana, in a seemingly tactical maneuver, summons one of her winged lions and takes to the skies. However, her departure from the battlefield soon becomes a full retreat, leaving the group to fend for themselves.

The battle proves arduous, with each member of the group sustaining significant injuries. Sir Roderick, overwhelmed, is forced to resort to firing from beneath his shield. Lugh, caught in the grasp of an excruciating hex, collapses the moment he attempts to heal himself.

Lugh's consciousness returns to the sensation of Archimedes administering a healing potion, an odd and disorienting revival. Following the intense battle, the group decides to take an hour's rest before sneaking into the enemy camp under the cover of night.

As they lie in wait at the forest's edge for darkness to cloak their approach, Suhana’s lion suddenly reappears overhead. Tragically, it is struck by necrotic beams emanating from the camp. The majestic creature plummets to the ground in a tight spiral, a harrowing sight that underscores the peril they are about to face.
