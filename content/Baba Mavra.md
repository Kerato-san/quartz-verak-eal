## Baba Mavra’s Background

**Description:** Baba Mavra is a twisted, ancient figure with gnarled hands, wild white hair, and eyes that glow with malevolent intelligence. She wears a patchwork cloak of animal furs and tattered cloth, and her hut is filled with strange artefacts and the smell of potent herbs. If the group ever makes their way to the basement, they will find a magic table adorned with children's bones. A scared child, Anya, is also found there. 

**Motivation:** Baba Mavra seeks power and control. She enjoys manipulating and tormenting the villagers, using fear and dark magic to maintain her influence. Her obsession with power drives her to seek ever more potent spells and artefacts. Unbeknownst to the villagers, Baba Mavra has the rusalka Mariya bound for power. They also do not know she wants to use the child as a next vessel for herself. 

**Personality:** Cunning, manipulative, and cruel. She delights in making others suffer but can be pragmatic when it serves her interests.

**Habits:** Collects rare ingredients for her spells, bargains with those desperate enough to seek her help, and maintains a network of spies and informants among the supernatural creatures of the forest.
### The Scared Child
**Name:** Anya Ivanova
**Description:** Anya is a young girl, around 8 years old, with wide, frightened eyes and matted hair. She wears tattered clothing and clings to a small, ragged doll for comfort. She is found in the basement of Baba Mavra’s hut, terrified and malnourished.
### Interaction with Baba Mavra

#### Interaction 1: Bargain with the Witch

**Request:** Baba Mavra demands assistance in collecting ingredients for a powerful and morally dubious spell.

**Spell:** The spell is designed to enhance Baba Mavra's power, allowing her to control the minds of the villagers more effectively. It requires rare and potent ingredients that can only be obtained through morally questionable means.

**Ingredients Required:**
1.  **A drop of innocent blood:** This must come from a child, a deeply unsettling task.
2. **The heart of a loyal beast:** This necessitates killing a beloved pet or guardian animal.
3. **A flower that only blooms in the presence of true despair:** This involves causing emotional pain to an innocent person.

**Moral Dilemma:**
- Helping Baba Mavra means contributing to her control over the villagers, which goes against the adventurers’ principles.
- Refusing to help or sabotaging the spell could result in her wrath and loss of any potential benefits.

**Boon:**
- **Powerful Potion:** A potion that grants significant advantages, such as temporary invulnerability or heightened senses.
- **Enchantment:** An item enchanted with powerful protective or offensive magic. *(what? I need to know what)*
- **Information:** Crucial details about the Frozen Bride and Castle Czernobog’s defences.

**Bane:**
- **Distrust of Villagers:** Helping Baba Mavra will make the villagers distrustful and fearful of the adventurers.
- **Potential Curse:** Baba Mavra could place a curse on the adventurers if they refuse or fail her task, resulting in bad luck or misfortune.

#### Interaction 2: Bargain for Information

**Request:** Baba Mavra requires something valuable in exchange for the information about the Frozen Bride and Castle Czernobog.

**What the group Must Give:**
- **A bound favour:** She wants a blood bound favour of a member of the group. She does a little ritual to bind the deal with blood of her and the participant.

**Boon:**
- **Detailed Map:** A detailed map of Castle Czernobog, including secret passages and hidden chambers.
  OR
- **Secrets of the Frozen Bride:** Information about how to awaken the Frozen Bride and the nature of the divine magic that keeps her in slumber. (what could that be?)

**Bane:**
- **Future Favour:** Baba Mavra will demand a future favour from the adventurers, which could be as morally ambiguous or dangerous as her current request.
- **Village’s Wrath:** The villagers may resent the adventurers for negotiating with Baba Mavra, potentially leading to hostile actions or betrayal.

#### Interaction 3: Slay the Witch

**Request:** The adventurers decide to rid the village of Baba Mavra’s malevolent influence.

**Boon:**
- **Gratitude of Villagers:** The group will free one of the children that was taken by Baba Mavra in a bargain with one of the villagers. The villagers are immensely grateful, offering their assistance, resources, and any information they possess.
- **Magical Relics:** The adventurers can claim any magical items or potions Baba Mavra has stored in her lair.
- **Curse Removal:** The removal of any curses or hexes she may have placed on the village or its inhabitants.

**Bane:**
- **Witch’s Dying Curse:** Baba Mavra’s final act is to place a powerful curse on the adventurers, which could cause ongoing harm or attract other malevolent forces.
- **Unforeseen Consequences:** The witch’s death might disrupt a delicate balance, potentially awakening other dormant evils or causing natural disasters.
