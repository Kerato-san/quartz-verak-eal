**The Shatter** is the defining event in the history of Verak’eal, marking the end of the Age of Gods and the beginning of the mortal era. It was a catastrophic yet intentional split of the once-unified realm into multiple planes, separating the gods from mortals and locking away their immense powers to prevent further destruction. The Shatter was the culmination of the **War of the Shatter**, a conflict that pitted the gods of **[[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]]** against **[[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]]**, with each faction fighting for control over the fate of the world.

# War of the Shatter  
The seeds of war were sown long before the Shatter, as the evil gods of Verak’eal, later dubbed [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], grew increasingly powerful. Corruption, greed, and domination spread throughout the realm as these gods, including [[./Gods/The Lost/Wendel|Wendel]], [[./Gods/The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]], and [[./Gods/The Lost/Nethira|Nethira]], sought to expand their influence over the mortal world. Wars broke out across the lands, instigated by these malevolent gods to further their ambitions. Entire kingdoms crumbled under their influence, with mortals suffering as pawns in their divine game.

In response to the chaos, other gods began to take action, seeking to curb the power of the evil gods. However, these early efforts were fragmented and uncoordinated, leading to only temporary relief. The world teetered on the brink of utter destruction as the gods of evil continued to gather strength.

## The Formation of The Grey  
It was in this time of great strife that [[./Gods/The Grey/Dathin|Dathin]] and [[./Gods/The Grey/The Porcelain Queen|The Porcelain Queen]] met in secret, recognizing that the only way to restore balance to the world was to contain the power of all gods, good and evil alike. Together, they devised a plan that would later be known as The Shatter. This plan involved the complete separation of the divine and mortal realms by shattering the single realm into multiple planes, imprisoning the gods within the outer planes while allowing the mortal world to heal and grow without constant divine interference.

[[./Gods/The Grey/Dathin|Dathin]] and [[./Gods/The Grey/The Porcelain Queen|The Porcelain Queen]] began recruiting other gods who shared their vision of balance and restraint. Over time, these gods coalesced into a unified force known as [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]]. Gods such as [[./Gods/The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]], [[./Gods/The Grey/Rindra|Rindra]], [[./Gods/The Grey/Sheleth|Sheleth]], and [[./Gods/The Grey/Varida|Varida]] joined the cause, bringing their unique strengths to the alliance. They fought not just to stop evil, but to preserve the world and limit divine influence altogether.

## The Leak and The Lost’s Response  
[[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] moved carefully, hiding their true intentions while battling [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] in scattered skirmishes. However, as their plans to enact The Shatter neared completion, word of the plan leaked to [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]]. Realizing the existential threat posed by [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]]’s plan, the gods of evil were forced to unite in desperation. 

[[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], though diverse in their goals and methods, banded together under the banner of survival. Gods like [[./Gods/The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]], [[./Gods/The Lost/Fax|Fax]], and [[./Gods/The Lost/Zarilith|Zarilith]] rallied their forces, pushing aside personal rivalries to mount a final, all-out war against [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]]. Thus, **The War of the Shatter** became a true divine conflict, with both sides fighting for control over the future of the mortal realm.

## The Battles of the Shatter  
The war was not fought in a single battle, but in a series of cataclysmic clashes that tore the fabric of reality itself. Massive battles erupted across Verak’eal, each one leaving scars upon the land and in the hearts of mortals. [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] sought to expand their influence, turning kingdoms to dust and corrupting entire civilisations. In contrast, [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] fought with precision, striking strategically to weaken [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] while trying to minimise the devastation to the mortal realm.

Famous battles included:
- **The Siege of Silverhold**, where [[./Gods/The Lost/Fax|Fax]]’s forces clashed with [[./Gods/The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]]’s armies in a brutal fight for dominion over the northern territories.
- **The Burning of Valisian Fields**, where [[./Gods/The Lost/Pentath|Pentath]]’s destruction left the land scorched and uninhabitable, forcing [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] into a retreat.
- **The Battle of Skystone**, where [[./Gods/The Grey/Mahatu|Mahatu]] fought against [[./Gods/The Lost/Namiut|Namiut]], his dark counterpart, in a fierce aerial battle that shattered the mountain range and changed the course of the war.

Each battle brought [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] closer to enacting their ultimate plan, but it also pushed the mortal world further toward the brink of annihilation.

## The Final Conflict and The Shatter  
After years of warfare, [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] finally manoeuvred into a position where they could enact The Shatter. The final battle was fought on the fields of **Kentron**, where the forces of [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] and [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] collided in a climactic confrontation. The air was thick with divine power, and the earth itself trembled under the weight of the conflict.

As the battle reached its height, [[./Gods/The Grey/Dathin|Dathin]] and [[./Gods/The Grey/The Porcelain Queen|The Porcelain Queen]] activated the ritual that would become The Shatter. The divine power unleashed in that moment was beyond comprehension, tearing the realm apart and scattering it into multiple planes. The gods, once able to walk freely among mortals, were now confined to their respective planes of existence, their influence on the material world restricted. 

[[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] were banished to the lower planes, imprisoned in realms of torment and chaos. [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] retreated to the outer planes, still able to guide and protect the mortal realm, but unable to directly intervene. Mortals were left to rebuild in the wake of the divine catastrophe, free from the constant interference of gods.

# Aftermath  
The Shatter was both a victory and a loss for [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]]. They succeeded in their goal of containing divine power, preventing [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] from destroying the world, but the consequences of the Shatter were profound. The world was forever changed, fragmented into planes of existence with the material plane at the centre. Mortals, while free from the direct influence of the gods, were left to navigate a shattered world where divine power still lingered, albeit from a distance.

For [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], the Shatter was a bitter defeat. Their powers were diminished, and they were confined to the lower planes, unable to roam freely. Yet, they still influence the mortal realm in subtle ways, seeking to break free from their imprisonment and reclaim the world they lost.

# Significance of The Shatter  
The Shatter marks the end of the **Age of Gods** and the beginning of the **Age of Discovery**. It serves as a reminder of the immense power the gods once wielded, and the destructive consequences of unchecked divine influence. [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] remains vigilant, ensuring that [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] remain confined, while [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] plot their eventual return.

The Shatter remains a pivotal moment in the history of Verak’eal, shaping the relationship between mortals and deities, and leaving a legacy of both hope and fear. It stands as a testament to the power of cooperation, but also as a warning of the dangers of divine war.
