*10 Sirorev, 1524*

As the group returns to Waldhein, they begin discussing how to distract the guards. Ideas are thrown around, including creating a fake fire or making a loud noise in the church. However, they soon abandon the idea of distraction. They ask Braya to describe Ralph's appearance.

The group decides that Gideon and Aina will grab the guards guarding the tower from behind while the others create a diversion outside the inn. At dusk, they sneak from the forest into the town, with Braya and Aina leading the way. Along the way, Braya prevents Aina from walking into a group of Warriors of Timnar, and Lugh guides Sir Fremont through the dark.

As they approach the inn, Lugh helps Sir Fremont navigate the dark.

The group enters the Inn via the back door and finalizes their plan before Aina and Gideon move two alleys over to start the ambush. The plan doesn't survive contact with the enemy, but Sir Fremont revives it. Gideon grabs the first guard but struggles to subdue him. Seeing that Aina is needed to succeed there, Sir Fremont rushes to the second guard and roughly grabs him, covering his mouth with a heavy gauntlet. Aina goes to Gideon to finish knocking out their guard. They drag them to the Inn where Aina and Lugh tie them up.

Afterwards, they sneak into the tower, where they see a hallway with three doors and a twisting stairway going up. As they reach the stairs, a commotion can be heard from the first door to the right.
