A mighty wizard who made the first accurate maps of the world. He used powerful scrying spells to determine what the world looked like

## Personal history

Simdan was a magical prodigy of his time. He was born in a kingdom that no longer exists on the continent of Zahria. He was particularly gifted in the magic art of divination. His interest in travel and exploration led him to scry for new land. He also became frustrated with the inaccuracies on many maps at the time. This made him pursue the goal of mapping the world accurately. With the knowledge from his travels and with the experience he gained through scrying, he was able to find magical ways that could reveal the whole world. This led to the first accurate world maps and globes.
