- Carceroy is a noble family with ties to Carceri, the evil plane of prisons. (also called theÂ Tarterian Depths of Carceri)
- A very obscure legend tells how the underground capital of Ziemyr was saved by the first Carceroy who banished the great theat of the Dakhanavar to the plane of Carceri. This granted them a knighthood and the newly established noble Carceroy family name.
- A more obscure detail is that the banishment was part of a pact with a Gehreleth (the fiends of Carceri). The fiend gave him the strength and tools needed to banish the threat. The fiend was paid with the prisoner (prisoners mean power in Carceri, almost like money). 
- Monster Slaying stays in the Carceroy family.
- Later, most global monster hunting groups would form a loose alliance under the name The Silver Order. The Order is a tapestry of many types of organizations, all with the goal to rid the world of evil monsters that disturb the natural order. The Silver Order helps prevent conflict between organizations by establishing boundaries where necessary. It also provides a way to ask for specialized aid or knowledge. 
- A few other dwarven families came to serve the Carceroy family, not all of them are nobles. This group of under the leadership of the Carceroy family is known as the Carceroy Chapter. Even with the multiple families, it's a small, relatively obscure group. 
- In the spirit of Carceri, the Carceroy Chapter also keeps some monsters prisoner for various reasons, like tests, potions, and elixirs.
- Some members of the Carceroy Chapter are 'silver hunters', something that was created out of the joined research of The Silver Order.

- The settle growing unrest in Ziemyr against Rickerach, the rulers of the two countries decided reestablish their relationship.
- In the new declaration of allegiance, Rickerach recognizes Ziemyr's independence and Ziemyr will side with Rickerach on above ground matters.
- As part of the Alliance between Ziemyr en Rickerach, the Carceroy family had to join the Chained Lodge with the Hirsche family. The Chained Lodge is mostly symbolic, but it does give the Carceroy Chapter better access to the above ground resources. As part of the Lodge above ground, monster in Rickerach also fall under their jurisdiction. 
- Not all members of the Carceroy Chapter are happy with the Chained Lodge and don't want to be used for symbolic politics. They don't like the extra attention either. Although, This hasn't led to many people recognizing the family name.
