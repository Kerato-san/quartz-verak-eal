*31 Sirorev 1524*

The group's journey through the temple’s enigmatic corridors takes a dramatic turn as they emerge from the waterlogged maze and find themselves in an enormous cylindrical tunnel. The structure, reminiscent of an ancient aqueduct or a colossal barrel, looms with a sense of foreboding and wonder. Its sheer size and the thickness of the air around them suggest a purpose far beyond the ordinary.

To their right, the tunnel abruptly ends, met by a wall that bristles with a menacing array of metal spikes. These spikes, gleaming in the dim light, are interspersed with an array of mysterious holes, hinting at hidden dangers within the walls. The sight is both fascinating and threatening, a silent testament to the temple's protective measures.

Turning to the left, the group faces another dead end, yet this one is devoid of spikes. However, this one is conspicuously free of the aggressive spikes seen on its counterpart. Instead, intricate arcane runes dance around a similar pattern of holes, glowing faintly with an otherworldly light. The runes seem to beckon for closer inspection, their luminescence suggesting a magic waiting to be unlocked or unleashed.

However, before they can contemplate their next move, the echoes of a heavy thud reverberate through the tunnel. They turn to find that their path back to the labyrinth is now sealed off by a massive stone barrier. Their only way forward lies within this mysterious tunnel.

Looking closely, they notice that the walls are adorned with rows of wind symbols, all pointing ominously towards the spiked wall. The pattern is interrupted only in the middle of the tunnel by three rows of symbols pointing in the opposite direction, towards what was once their entrance but is now simply another segment of wall adorned with the same enigmatic symbols.

When [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] steps off the three central rows of tiles, the runes on both dead ends of the tunnel begin to radiate with energy. Suddenly, a ferocious gale erupts, transforming the once-still tunnel into a roaring wind tunnel. The group is caught off guard as the howling wind thrusts them perilously towards the wall of spikes.

In this moment of crisis, they rely on both physical ingenuity and magical aids. Ropes become lifelines, and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]]’s magical floating disks offer crucial support. Despite their efforts, some members of the group are caught by the spikes' cruel embrace. With swift action, they manage to free the impaled before any fatal damage can be inflicted.

Amidst the chaos, Sir Roderick discerns the solution to their predicament. By strategically placing weight on the right side of the central circle, they discover it acts as a massive wheel. As they manipulate the circle, the three centre rows of the tunnel begin to rotate, moving the sealed door into alignment with the opposite side. With a final, concerted effort, they align the door, and as it swings open, the torrential winds abruptly cease, granting them a moment of respite and the passage to continue their perilous journey.

The group steps into a chamber that can only be described as majestic. Its vast expanse is crowned by a vaunted ceiling, illuminated by crystals emitting beams of prismatic light. The atmosphere is one of reverence and awe.

At the far end of the chamber stands a raised dais, upon which rests a statue of a dragonborn. The statue exudes an aura of wisdom, its gaze penetrating, hands clasped in a gesture of contemplation or perhaps prayer.

Flanking the central figure are two grand statues of dragonborn warriors, each brandishing massive hammers as if ready for battle. Carved into the pedestals of these imposing figures is the rune for “earth,” adding an element of elemental mystique to the room.

The walls are adorned with painted reliefs, each telling a part of a grand narrative. On one side, an army of red dragon cavalry and dragonborn infantry is depicted, led by a commanding dragonborn marked by a red triangle on his wrist. The opposite wall portrays a scene of mourning, the same army paying their last respects to their fallen leader, the red triangle now resting in his clasped hands.

Above, the ceiling features a breathtaking mural of a flight of dragons, all seeming to converge towards the dais at the chamber's end. The group speculates that the red triangle might be the very artifact they seek.

[[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]], drawing on intuition, suggests placing Alokir’s sword in the hands of the dragonborn statue on the dais. This act triggers a hidden mechanism, revealing a door behind the dais. Through this newly uncovered passage, Archimedes is able to fly and retrieve a red pyramid-shaped crystal from within a sarcophagus in the adjoining room, presumably the sought-after artifact.
