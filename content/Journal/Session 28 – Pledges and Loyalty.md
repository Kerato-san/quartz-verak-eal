*31 Sirorev 1524 – 32 Sirorev 1524*

As the group makes their return journey through the temple, they find the traps that once threatened their progress now mysteriously deactivated. In a moment of unexpected camaraderie, one of the water elementals even embraces [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] in a watery hug, a gesture of peace or perhaps gratitude.

Deciding to spend one more night within the temple's ancient walls, they settle in for a rest. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]], in particular, experiences a vivid and peculiar dream. He feels as if he's submerged in water, then suddenly dried by a warm breeze. He senses both falling and floating, a disorienting sensation that ends with him landing softly on a hard surface, unscathed. The dream is void of fear, imbued instead with an odd sense of tranquility.

But then, the dream shifts. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] finds himself in a field dotted with trees bearing colorful blossoms under the glow of a full moon. Leaves dance on the wind, which carries a message to him: “Pleasant dreams, but not from me. Dreams such as that one are in danger. You will need a bit of help, so I will give you a gift.”

Awakening from this enigmatic dream, the group departs the temple and heads back to the kobold town. There, they report their findings to Elder Krazik, handing over Alokir’s sword and explaining its significance as the key to the crypt.

As the group prepares to depart the kobold village, Elder Krazik consents to their removal of the Heartstone from the valley. However, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] solemnly commits to a blood vow on the Mane of [[../Gods/The Grey/Kalin|Kalin]], swearing to return the artifact or face death. This vow is solidified by a small, yet significant, ceremony conducted by the Elder.

Leaving the village, they notice ominous plumes of smoke rising at the valley's entrance. Despite this foreboding sign, they decide to proceed, sending their familiars ahead for reconnaissance. Archimedes heads directly towards the source of the smoke, while Asra remains within a hundred feet of [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]]. From Archimedes' report, they learn of a sizable group of people ahead, still unaware of their presence.

The group decides to set up an ambush. Initially, it seems successful until two assassins, shrouded in darkness, launch a surprise attack on Sir Roderick and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]]. The assailants, invisible in their cloak of shadows, prove to be elusive targets. Meanwhile, the other visible enemies focus on hexing and blinding [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]].

In response, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] is compelled to manifest his wings and call upon guardian spirits to strike at their foes. His actions prove decisive, aiding in the defeat of [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]]'s last attacker. However, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] soon realizes that his wings, which usually fade after a short duration, remain unfurled and, surprisingly, appear physical rather than ethereal. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] points out this transformation, leaving [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] to wonder if this is the 'gift' mentioned in his dream.

[[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] assists [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] in adjusting his armor to accommodate his new wings, while Asra takes an interest in preening them. Faced with this unexpected change, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] resolves to adapt to his new situation until he can acquire armor specifically designed for his altered form.
