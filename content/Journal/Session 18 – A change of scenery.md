_19 Sirorev 1524_

In the Palace of the Portalis, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] and the group noticed that the guards wore livery with a circular pattern, likely a reference to the Portalis itself. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] Watson decided to entertain himself by antagonizing the attendant with terrible jokes, but [[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Roderick]] improved the situation by paying for their travel.

They were guided through a lavish interior adorned with depictions of the royal roses to a domed room. Inside, stone circles were engraved on the ground, adorned with glowing runes. In the centre was an obsidian slab with slots for rune tablets, and attendants retrieved the tablets from nearby cabinets. Inserting the tablets for Mohanpura, the stone circles rotated into position and began to glow. An attendant signalled them to step into the main circle.

As they did, they experienced a sensation of fast movement while standing still, accompanied by the sound of rushing wind and crackling static. While most of the group managed reasonably well without too much nausea, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] had to calm down Saulé, his mule. When the experience ended, they found themselves in a place remarkably similar to their starting point, though the humidity and scent of spices confirmed that they had arrived in Mohanpura.

The attendant instructed them to avoid physical exertion for the next half-hour to recover from the journey. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] inquired about Anjali Patel, who was supposed to meet them, and was told to check the lobby. They learned that the alignment of the Portalises was coordinated using sending stones.

The lobby in Mohanpura was more decadent than the one in Feldenburg, filled with the scents of incense, spices, and offerings. It overlooked the city, which was built on an incline overlooking a jungle. Several other groups of travellers were also present. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] once again asked about Patel and received a map with directions to the university.

To reach the university, they needed to go through the marketplace, continue to the Grand Bazaar, pass through the guild district, and reach a crossroads. They were to turn left and see the Ivory Tower in the distance. Before arriving at the tower, they will arrive at the Hanging Gardens. Near the Gardens, they would come across the Celestial Observatory and University, the destination. The map also highlighted other points of interest, including the Arena of Champions, the golden domes of the Palace, and the Serpent’s Tail inn near the bazaar.

While descending the grand staircase to the marketplace, they tidied up their clothing as best they could. In the bustling market, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] purchased a local outfit, and both [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] acquired some items. Near the bazaar, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] noticed an individual who had also been in the marketplace, leading her and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] to suspect they were being followed.

They turned towards a less crowded entrance to the guild district and were eventually confronted by their pursuers in the alchemist's street. Diplomacy failed, so they fled, ducking into a side street where [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] created an illusory wall to block their path. Although their attempts to escape were not entirely successful, working together, they managed to shake off their pursuers.

However, during their escape, Saulé was left behind. It wasn't long before they encountered a local woman riding a winged six-legged lion with a white coat. She introduced herself as Suhana Patel and summoned two more lions, offering them a ride to the Ivory Tower and Hanging Gardens. As they travelled, her lion picked up Saulé, who had been left behind during their earlier run.

After landing, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] expressed his appreciation to the lion he had ridden, sensing that it was a fey creature. Ms. Patel explained that she was a linguist studying Draconic scriptures, and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] seized the opportunity to showcase their linguistic skills. In between their linguistic antics, they learned that their pursuers were mercenaries, likely hired by Ravi Singh, a wealthy collector.

They informed Suhana Patel that they had been sent by [[../Places/Thymios/The University of Feldenburg|The University of Feldenburg]] to find and assist Dr. Gupta and that they were expecting to meet Anjali Patel.
