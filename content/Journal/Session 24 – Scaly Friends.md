*30 Sirorev 1524*

The startled kobold, now identified as Oko, hesitantly begins to communicate with the group. Oko, a small draconic creature with brown scales, is convinced to lead them to his village, nestled deep in the heart of the jungle. The village that greets them is a vibrant tapestry of color, adorned with fabrics that echo the diverse hues of the kobolds' scales, and even robes mimicking the patterns of scales.

In the bustling town square, they are met by Elder Krazik, a kobold distinguished by his dulled grey scales and the sharp, perceptive glint in his eyes. He addresses them in a screechy but authoritative Draconic, his voice carrying across the square, "Why do you seek the temple of our ancestors?" Suhana provides translations from old Draconic, bridging the gap between their languages.

The group's earnest responses and respectful demeanor earn them the chance to face the trials of Mahatu, a prerequisite to locating the temple. During a shared meal, they foster goodwill with the kobold community, listening intently as Elder Krazik narrates their rich history.

Krazik reveals that the kobolds have been guardians of the valley as long as the temple has existed. In times long past, Mahatu himself would visit to bestow his blessings. To find the temple, one must undergo trials that reveal its hidden location. No non-kobold had attempted these trials in Krazik's memory. The elder’s willingness to let them undertake this challenge now makes sense; failure could mean eternal entrapment within the jungle's deceptive illusions.

After the meal, Krazik and Oko escort the group to the cavern where the trials await. With a note of solemnity, Krazik imparts his final warning, “Fail and be lost in the jungle, forever blinded by the illusion that hides the temple. Succeed and the path will be clear."

As the group entered the cave, holding tightly to one another, the oppressive darkness swiftly separated them. In the echoing void, Lugh heard a mocking voice amidst the howling wind, bidding him to "have fun." A familiar, bracing presence he had unknowingly relied upon slipped away, replaced by a new, warm embrace, which he assumed to be Mahatu’s.

Lugh found himself facing a daunting chasm, with a narrow bridge leading to a raging wyvern separated by a barrier. Trusting in Mahatu, he courteously notified the wyvern of his intention to enter its territory and stepped through the barrier. The wyvern turned out to be a mere illusion and posed no threat, but the sheer depth of the chasm induced a vertigo that held him back. Only upon realizing he could manifest wings did he soar across the chasm to safety.

The next chamber presented a  circular room with a plinth at the center, adorned with dragon motifs. The riddle inscribed on the plinth read in common:

“I bear the weight of a dragon’s trust,  
nestled in earth concealed from lust,  
round and warm, a future’s shell,  
what am I, with a secret to tell?”

Seeming almost too straightforward, Lugh uttered "a dragon’s egg," and the door to the next chamber swung open.

He entered a cavern filled with crystal formations, where a growling, multi-hued wyvern lay amidst shattered crystals. Its display of unfurled wings, stirring the air, confirmed it was no illusion. Lugh cautiously approached, assessing both the creature's condition and the potential presence of eggs. The wyvern, wary, retreated, shedding crystal shards.

As Lugh reached out, a crystal shard pierced his hand. Removing it, he noticed blood, then searched for more blood-stained shards, finding an old, brown-stained one. His magical healing won over the wyvern's trust, allowing him to draw near and extract a shard embedded in its leg. As he did so, the grinding sound of a door opening echoed through the chamber. When he turned back, the wyvern had vanished.
