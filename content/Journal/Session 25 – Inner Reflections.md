*30 Sirorev 1524*

In a room resonating with arcane energy, the group finds themselves in an extraordinary situation. The twelve-sided chamber, crowned with a domed ceiling adorned with elemental symbols, presents them with a mystifying spectacle: two duplicates of each member, real and illusory counterparts facing each other. At the heart of the room's floor is etched a cryptic sentence: “ƎVAƎ˩ YAM ƎИO Y˩ИO.”

The team embarks on a series of experiments to decipher the room's enigma. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]]'s attempt to change [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]]'s sari to blue results in the duplicate [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]]’s sari turning yellow, hinting at the mechanics of the illusion. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]]’s use of a light spell confirms his authenticity, as his counterpart creates shadows, a feat beyond his abilities. They also discover that healing spells seem to harm the counterparts.

Hidden wands found in the chamber walls provide further insights. It becomes clear that they must confront their duplicates with the element most associated with them, inflicting more damage on the illusory figures than on themselves. Any mistakes would lead to a magical reset, restoring them to full health.

Intriguingly, the chamber associates [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] with the element of water, a curious choice that leaves him pondering its significance.

Upon completing the trial, they awake on the cold stone floor of a dark cave. Exiting the cavern, they are warmly greeted by Krazik, Oko, and Kavi, who express their relief and joy at the group's successful completion of the trials.

The evening's celebratory dinner is marked by the sharing of the legend of Alokir the Radiant, a noble dragonborn who, during the era of the Shattering, wielded the Dragon’s Heartstone. This powerful gem, containing a fragment of [[../Gods/The Grey/Mahatu|Mahatu]]’s power, enabled him to command the forces of light.

The following morning, as they depart the town, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] spots the tip of a stone structure peeking above the jungle canopy. The once-concealed temple now reveals itself to their sight. Halfway up the temple is a massive stone dragon head, its open maw serving as the grand entrance to the sacred edifice.
