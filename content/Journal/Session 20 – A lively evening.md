_19 Sirorev 1524_

The group sneaked cautiously to room 28, aware of potential onlookers from other buildings, though nobody appeared to be observing them specifically.

Upon entering, they were greeted by a hot, musty atmosphere that suggested the room had been closed off for an extended period. The walls were lined with bookshelves, although it was evident that some books were missing. The ones that remained covered a range of general topics.

[[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]]'s keen senses detected traces of magic on the doors and windows, indicating possible alarm spells. To investigate further, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] stealthily descended, with Akila providing aerial surveillance. Meanwhile, Archimedes kept a vigilant watch for any approaching figures.

As [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] explored, it became apparent that the source of the alarm was actually Dr. Gupta himself. Once this revelation emerged, the group quietly exited the building. Their next destination was Jehli, a student bar, where they could blend into the bustling crowd.

After a brief respite, the team embarked on a second covert visit to Dr. Gupta's apartment. They found the scholar had fallen asleep while awaiting their return.

Dr. Gupta revealed that he had been researching the elusive temple for an extended period. It was intercepted communications with [[../Characters/Professor Felwurd Einbach|Professor Einbach]] that had alerted him to the possibility of being under surveillance. He surmised that the mercenaries would prefer to trail him and await an opportunity to follow him to the temple, but if that plan failed, they might resort to more forceful measures.

Should they succeed in their mission, Dr. Gupta expressed his desire for the artefact to be transported to Feldenburg, or, at the very least, removed from Mohanpura.

The group also mentioned Ravi Singh, which piqued Dr. Gupta's curiosity. He inquired about how they had come across Singh's name, prompting them to recount their encounter with Suhana Patel. Dr. Gupta said he knew of her and presented a translated Draconic prayer, which had been rendered by Patel and was found within one of the books on his shelves.

With a growing body of evidence to support his theory, Dr. Gupta outlined the reasons behind his belief that the temple was located within the Chamak Valley. The evidence included ancient scriptures and maps, an ornate tablet unearthed from the valley, local legends among tribes, dragon statuettes of sillimanite, and the peculiar alignment of the [[../Gods/The Grey/Mahatu|Mahatu]] temple in Mohanpura pointing directly toward the valley. Although his previous attempt in the valley years ago proved futile.

A plan was hatched to ride elephants to a village close to the valley, seeking assistance from a local tribe who held knowledge of a place where dragons purportedly slumbered.

It was decided that they would spend the night at the Serpent’s Tail, a vibrant inn bustling with activity. The sheer number of patrons provided a deterrent against potential attacks. They arranged to meet at the elephants’ stable near the largest Northern gate an hour after sunrise to commence their journey.

The Serpent’s Tail offered a sensory feast with serpent motifs adorning mosaics, belly dancers captivating the audience with sequined costumes, the tantalizing aroma of spiced meats, and the sweet scent of incense that filled the air. The lively establishment echoed with passionate debates and the distinct clinking of merchants' coins.

[[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]], keen-eyed as ever, spotted Suhana Patel at the bar. While the group secured rooms, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] approached Suhana to catch up and persuade her to join their mission. The two enjoyed a pleasant drink together at the bar. Suhana apparently suspected they would stay here.

Following a satisfying dinner at a well-appointed table in the tavern section of the inn, everyone retired to their rooms.
