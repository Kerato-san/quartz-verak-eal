_12 Sirorev 1524 â€“ 19 Sirorev 1524_

From the stable keeper and farrier, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] and the group learned that Sander had arrived late the previous night, rented a new horse, and claimed to be on a mission to deliver an urgent message. He had ridden further downstream. They informed the innkeeper of the situation in Waldhein so that help could be sent.

Heading to the boat waiting for them, the Flying Fish, they found Captain Elias. Although he had received their message, he hadn't seen Sander arrive or leave. They decided to travel downstream at night and were pleased that the crew could get them moving in just half an hour. In the next town, Dendorf, there was no trace of the recent rider.

While the crew of the Flying Fish had some downtime, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] decided to use the magical tattoo [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] had given him to summon a familiar. An exquisite owl with velvety black feathers, white spots, and a white facial disk appeared.

Since no rider appeared, they continued their journey back to Feldenburg, arriving around noon on the 18th. As they were heading to the University, an old woman stopped [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]], grabbed his wrist, and said with white eyes, "Never Swim Alone." When he looked at his companions and back at her, she was back to playing with the children around her. Neither his companions nor the children seemed to notice the strange interaction, and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] chose not to share it with the group.

Upon arriving at the university, they reported to the secretary, Rudolphus. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]]'s behaviour irritated him, but with [[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Roderick]] vouching for them, he went to inform [[../Characters/Professor Felwurd Einbach|Professor Einbach]] of their presence. In the meeting with [[../Characters/Professor Felwurd Einbach|Professor Einbach]], [[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Roderick]] provided a report on their conduct and performance, with generally positive feedback, aside from the need for better communication. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]], however, announced his decision not to continue with the group. After which, he was offered a position at the university to study the artifacts they had retrieved. They agreed to keep in touch.

[[../Characters/Professor Felwurd Einbach|Professor Einbach]] had another candidate in mind to join their group, whom they would meet the next day. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] joined the others in shopping for equipment, and they visited Zia's Emporium, run by a jet black tiefling with ashen horns named Zia. The proprietor was outgoing and extravagant, introducing themselves as Zia. They were very helpful in providing the group with what they required, and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] seemed to enjoy their company.

The following day, they met [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] Watson, an interesting individual who seemed to fit well with the team. He introduced himself with magical fanfare and jokes. [[../Characters/Professor Felwurd Einbach|Professor Einbach]] assigned them to a new mission: Dr. Rajan Gupta was close to discovering an ancient temple to [[../Gods/The Grey/Mahatu|Mahatu]], possibly hidden by illusions. Given suspicions of intercepted communications, time was of the essence. The temple might be the resting place of one of [[../Gods/The Grey/Mahatu|Mahatu]]'s underlings, potentially buried with fragments of [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]]. This was in Pramiti and we would need to go to the capital Mohanpura by way of the Portalis.

After the meeting, they picked up their ordered equipment and headed to the Portalis, located in a palace-like building in the noble neighbourhood.
