_11 Sirorev 1524_

Before initiating her ritual, Isabella kindly offered her expertise in identifying various items for the group. These included the raven figurine, a cloak of shielding, bracers of defence, and the swords Fang and Chisel.

After their well-deserved rest, the group returned to Isabella, who now bore visible signs of having aged years in a single night, with streaks of grey in her hair. With time running short, the group hurriedly made their way through the opening in the barrier and stepped through the portal. On the other side awaited a vast cavern, adorned with colossal stalagmites and tube-shaped, luminescent fungi. Deeper within, an otherworldly forest comprised of tree-sized mushrooms cast an eerie and alien ambiance.

Alongside one of the cave walls, the ruin of a massive temple stood, appearing as though it had been plucked from its foundation and flung against the cavern wall. While much of the temple lay in ruins, the primary structure remained remarkably intact. Affixed above the main doors was the symbol of [[../Gods/The Grey/Atheca|Atheca]], while the wall beside the doors displayed a large gash.

To the left and right sides of the temple structure were two smaller openings in the walls, and the group chose to explore the left one. Carvings on the wall depicted a bearded man in robes engaged in a magical duel with another figure wielding a radiant crystal. Passing by the main doors, they observed that one door lay on the ground, while the other remained in place, adorned with tiny, hand-shaped scripture. Through the open doorway, a flickering blue light was visible, seemingly moving away before extinguishing. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] suspected it might be a will-o'-wisp.

Upon reaching the breach, they ventured inside and found themselves in a dormitory that had once housed young clerics and wizards in the service of [[../Gods/The Grey/Atheca|Atheca]]. In the corner, a blue light coalesced into the form of an older elven lady adorned in symbol-covered robes, her hair in a braid. Two sets of chains encircled her, bearing [[../Gods/The Grey/Atheca|Atheca]]'s symbol on the locks. She greeted them with a gentle smile and expressed her reluctance to have the chains removed, as they served as her protection. The elven lady revealed that the Orb of Undeath was originally a constantly replenishing conduit of magical power crafted for battling [[../Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]]—those who found themselves on the wrong side of the border. Over time, the orb had been corrupted from a sphere of magical energy into a dark, necrotic source of energy.

She implored the group to maintain the barrier's integrity and keep the orb contained. They proceeded hastily to the main Cathedral, where they heard a protracted, unsettling moan that shifted between human and inhuman. Cedric's voice echoed, proclaiming, "The orb is mine; your time is over." It seemed like it wasn’t directed at the group.

Within the Cathedral bathed in green light, they encountered two figures locked in combat. Cedric wielded dark tendrils of eldritch energy, while the other figure was a monstrous, clawed entity of blackened granite. Cedric managed to destroy this figure, causing it to disintegrate. Despite their initial intent to attack Cedric, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] chose to employ a Hold Person spell, which succeeded. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]], however, sustained severe injuries while attempting to secure the orb, as touching it proved nearly fatal.

Though Cedric was incapacitated for much of the battle due to the hold spell, he still proved difficult. Luckily, the group had secured the upper hand. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] eventually dealt the finishing blow, replacing Cedric's tongue with an arrow through the neck. The group transported Cedric's lifeless body to the portal, while [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] continued to explore the building, discovering what appeared to be a magical cloak in a deep shade of purple. The portal sealed shut once Cedric's corpse had passed through it, prompting the group to hasten back through the barrier, thus relieving Isabella of her strenuous duty.
