31st Korovel 1524.

Upon arrival in Feldenburg, the applicants are taken to the Stained Parchment Inn by a guide named Ronald Ekker. There they have a prepaid private room. The Stained Parchment Inn is located in the university square. They are led one by one to the receptionist, who tells them to wait. In the reception hall are several waiting people of all kinds. Finally, [[../Characters/Ander Janessy|Ander]] and two others, a dwarf and an Aasimar, are called together and taken to a hall of curiosities. Artefacts are present in the hall. There are also a few students who are directly addressed by [[../Characters/Ander Janessy|Ander]]. One of the students is called Julia, and she plans to meet [[../Characters/Ander Janessy|Ander]] later at the Inn.

Finally, they are let into [[../Characters/Professor Felwurd Einbach|Professor Einbach]]'s office. The professor calls them by name, one by one.

- [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh Aynurdaris]] - Aasimar. Recommended for actions he took while helping to excavate a tomb

- [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy]] - Dwarf. Known from the Royal University of Rosenberg

- [[../Characters/Ander Janessy|Ander Janessy]] - Human. Grave robber that became archaeologist.

The professor explains that in recent years many ruins have been found from the old times before the Shatter. As a result, many artifacts have also been found. These can be potentially very dangerous. Lately, there has been a clear and organized effort to get hold of these artifacts by an as-yet-unknown faction. Convoys carrying artifacts are also attacked. Well-known bandit mercenaries and figures in dark robes have been seen during the attacks, who directed the bandits from afar. There may be an internal spy in governments or universities.

[[../Places/Thymios/The University of Feldenburg|The University of Feldenburg]] owns a "Shard of the Shatter". That's the name [[../Characters/Professor Felwurd Einbach|Einbach]] gave to pre-Shatter artifacts that got their power from the gods. The university has the Orb of Prophesy.

This orb is presented by [[../Characters/Professor Felwurd Einbach|Einbach]] and offered to everyone to take the orb in their hands and tell what we get to see. Sir Carceroy and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] report their adventure with the other two of the group. Janessy has the same vision when he gets the orb, but instead of returning it, he uses a gadget and teleports out. There he runs from roof to roof and steals the orb. While fleeing, he yells at the others that he owes them a drink.

[[../Characters/Professor Felwurd Einbach|Einbach]] remains calm, but does warn the guards. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] and Carceroy try to follow half-heartedly, but it doesn't work out very well. The professor tells them when they come back that the orb was not real, but just a "mirror".

Now [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina Loracan]] is added to the group to replace [[../Characters/Ander Janessy|Ander]]. She is also offered the orb and strangely enough she has the same vision. The professor tells the group that the vision is a reflection of their future, but not an actual future. They are reinforced by another knight named Roderick Fremont. He is a former Royal Guard from Rosenberg and now has the position of a guard of knowledge. The group is given a mission to search for two missing archaeologists, Isabella from Destania and Farah from [[../Places/Zharia/Nasreen|Nasreen]]. They were looking for a magical temple in Waldhein, and they are now missing. After the conversation, it's later in the day so they go back to the Inn.
