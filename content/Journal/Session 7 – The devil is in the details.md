_9 Sirorev 1524_

The group follows Snowflake on the long way around to avoid the hallway with the suit of armour. In the study, they re-examine the bust of Salazar Tam, a powerful Lich who once ruled a large part of Destania. The group notices that the bust can pivot forward, so they try it out. As they do so, the hearth in the room opens up, revealing a secret hallway with smooth, granite-like stone walls.

The group asked Snowflake if her master was in trouble, but the white Almiraj shook her head. They heard a creepy voice coming from the next room, responding ambiguously to their question of whether it was Farah or Isabella. Peering into the room, they found a laboratory filled with glass apparatuses, glowing potions, and a cage containing three small creatures with flapping wings that turned out to be smoke, dust, and steam mephits.

As they pushed the door open further, a magic sigil on the roof triggered and opened the cage, freeing the mephits. The group was caught off guard as the mephits attacked with their breath weapons, burning and blinding them. After attacking wildly, the group eventually emerged victorious. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] took some potions and alchemy supplies, just in case they would be needed later.

The group finds themselves in a tunnel filled with a pungent smell. Politely knocking on the door at the end of the hallway, they were treated to an interesting sight. Isabella was questioning a summoned devil while Farah was supporting her, Isabella’s eyes completely black. The devil tried to convince them that Farah and Isabella were the cause of Waldhein’s problems and they should release it. The group ignored it and told Farah and Isabella they’d wait until they were done, but Farah went with them to the dining room. Accompanied by Farah, they were not attacked by the armor in the main hall.

The group is offered food while waiting for Isabella to arrive. After a while, Isabella shows up with her normal amber eyes. They exchange knowledge of the situation at hand. Farah's intuition suggests Cedric may have something to do with the curse, while Isabella reveals that the Archduke of the Undead, Aanzor, is the source of the problem.

Isabella and Farah were attacked by ruffians, who were revealed to be the Warriors of [[../Gods/The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]] after their death. Isabella used a spell to interrogate on of the corpses. However, Isabella lost control of the corpses to Aanzor corrupting presence and had to release the spell.

They discuss the books and papers they ordered, which turned out to be the same ones found in the church of [[../Gods/The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]]. The papers contain the approximate location of [[../Gods/The Grey/Atheca|Atheca]]'s temple, which is on the hill behind the church. Unfortunately, the exact location is not mentioned in the papers.

[[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] politely prays to the goddess [[../Gods/The Grey/Atheca|Atheca]] and meditates on Isabella's minor illusion spell to get her attention. He asks for the location of her temple and receives a small hint that it is on a hill, confirming their suspicions.

After dinner, served by the unseen servant Manuel, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] help Farah repair her bed birds.
