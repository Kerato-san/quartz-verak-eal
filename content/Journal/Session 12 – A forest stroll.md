As Roderick dashed forward to clear the next alley, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] attempted to draw the attention of nearby zombies with a loud thunderous spell. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]], armed with her new magic sword, tested its effects against a zombie but found no clear magical effect. With Roderick's assistance, she climbed up onto the roof of a nearby house. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] manifested his wings and flew up after her, intending to assist the rest of the group in reaching the rooftop. After Roderick climbed up with [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] distracting the zombies, he pulled [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] up as well.

Akila was sent off with [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]]'s shiny new bell to draw away some of the pursuing zombies before the group attempted to navigate the rooftops. Initially, their progress was marred by noise, and the zombies followed. However, it seemed the undead lacked pattern recognition, allowing the group to evade them. A few roofs later, where they managed to remain quiet, they safely descended and stealthily proceeded through the town and the surrounding fields. As they reached the forest, they encountered more zombies heading toward town, inadvertently revealing the path to the temple.

After finding a secluded clearing, the group took a much-needed rest to allow Roderick to recover from the beating he had taken from the zombies. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] took on the role of a scout, forging ahead and eventually discovering a large double door set into the hillside within a stone arch. Above the door, a carving of a boar caught her attention.

Guarding the entrance were two mostly decomposed undead, one of which displayed an unsettling intelligence behind its eyes. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] coordinated her plan with the group and stealthily moved back to snipe the intelligent undead. She managed to land two shots before they fully engaged the group, vanishing in the forest. They started to dart back and forth across the path, targeting one member of the group with each pass before disappearing in the bushes again.

The group advanced to the clearing, prepared to strike or shoot the zombies as they passed. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] ended the skirmish by tripping the mindless zombie and using a caustic brew to dispatch it. The other zombie attempted to attack [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] but received an arrow from [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] for its efforts. Upon closer inspection, the intelligent zombie turned out to be an elf wearing attire from the First Age. However, it had taken on ghoul-like qualities and exhibited elongated, digitigrade limbs.

The group moved in absolute silence, no sounds of bird calls or skittering animals reaching their ears. They approached the imposing double doors, which appeared to have been forced open against their normal direction of opening. A sickly green glow emanated from braziers within, casting eerie light. A short corridor led to a balcony overlooking a wide and lengthy hallway supported by six stone pillars. At the far end, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] could barely discern the outline of a giant-sized statue shrouded in gloom. On the left side of the balcony were double doors set into the walls, and they could just make out a single door at the bottom of the right staircase.
