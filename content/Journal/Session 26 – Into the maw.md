As the group steps into the gaping maw that serves as the temple's entrance, they are immediately enveloped in an atmosphere that speaks of ancient silence and preservation. The coolness of the age-old stones contrasts sharply with the jungle's humidity, creating an almost sacred quietness that buffers the cacophony of the outside world.

They find themselves in an expansive hall, its grandeur marked by rows of pillars. Each pillar is a storyteller in its own right, intricately carved with the tales of [[../Gods/The Grey/Mahatu|Mahatu]] and Alokir, interspersed with majestic depictions of dragons. The carvings, a testament to the artistry of ancient times, seem to bring the legends to life as the group passes by.

At the far end of the hall, a statue of [[../Gods/The Grey/Mahatu|Mahatu]] stands in a protective stance over an altar. Time has faded its glory, but remnants of gold leaf cling stubbornly to the statue, hinting at its past splendor. In an alcove nearby, the group discovers depictions of six legendary dragons and dragonborns, their images etched into the stone with reverence.

Their exploration of the pyramid-shaped temple reveals several key chambers: a prayer room resonating with silent invocations, a clergy room where the echoes of past discussions still seem to linger, the high priest’s quarters filled with a palpable sense of authority, and Alokir’s personal room, a space that feels both intimate and powerful.

Oko informs them that parts of the temple are actively maintained by Krazik, his daughter, and a team of about ten skilled artisans. It's in Alokir’s chambers that they uncover treasures hidden away from the eyes of time: minor magical items, an iridescent scale mail neck guard, and an ancient blade adorned with a dragon motif, its edge still sharp enough to cut through the veil of centuries.

The group's exploration of the temple continues as they return to the prayer room, where a dragonborn statuette catches their attention on one of the shelves. Curiously, when turned to the side, the statuette begins to hiss ominously. Moments later, a fireball engulfs the room, sparked into life by the incense. It becomes clear that the statue releases a gas which, when ignited, serves to heat a plate in the ceiling adorned with a sun symbol—a heat-based mechanism that had lain dormant until their discovery.

As the group contemplates this ancient technology, a door on the opposite side of the room swings open, revealing a staircase descending into the depths of the temple. At the bottom, they find themselves in front of a set of stone double doors, above which a plaque solemnly declares, “Only the initiated may enter Alokir’s final resting place.” Undeterred, they open the door and step through, only to hear a loud click as the doors slam shut behind them. Flames suddenly burst forth from the floor just a few feet ahead.

The challenge before them is a daunting 50-foot stretch of floor tiles, each rigged with flamethrowers activating in a complex, timed pattern. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] carefully navigates the perilous path, skillfully avoiding the worst of the flames and revealing the safe pattern to the others. The rest of the group follows, with a few minor missteps resulting in some light singeing.

Their next trial is a maze, its floor submerged under knee-deep water that flows continuously. Every time they are forced to backtrack, a water elemental in the form of a dragon surges forth to challenge them. After two intense encounters with these elemental guardians, they finally discover the exit.

Exhausted but undeterred, they take a well-deserved rest before bracing themselves to enter the next chamber, the mysteries of the temple continuing to unfold before them.
