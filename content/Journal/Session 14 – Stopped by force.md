_11 Sirorev 1524_

As the group continued their exploration of the tomb, they came across a wall with a sizable hole that led into a recently excavated cave. Recognizing this as a potential route to explore later, they decided to ensure their safety by investigating the rest of the tomb before proceeding further.

Beyond the next door, they discovered a flight of stairs leading up to a hallway adorned with alcoves and grave-shelves. At the end of this passage, a creaking door revealed a chamber containing four sarcophagi, three of which had been opened, each containing a body. In the centre of the room stood a large stone symbol of [[../Gods/The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]], positioned to face the doors leading to the balcony where they had initially entered the crypt.

Taking precautions against a potential rear attack, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] used Word of Radiance to examine two of the corpses, inadvertently summoning three menacing shadows. The malicious entities immediately targeted [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]], nearly draining his strength entirely. However, the rest of the group quickly intervened, placing themselves between [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] and the shadows to fend off the life-draining attackers. With the combined efforts of [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]], they managed to vanquish the shadows, although not without sustaining some injuries themselves. The group recuperated briefly on the balcony before pressing forward.

Their exploration eventually led them to the last uncharted area. Behind a wooden door, they discovered an oval-shaped room adorned with broken pews and a large statue of [[../Gods/The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]]. Inscribed on the statue's pedestal were the words "If one stays true of heart, every hardship can be faced," a quote from the myths surrounding [[../The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]]â€”a phrase attributed to [[../Gods/The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]] as he addressed his followers before a significant battle. The room's walls were adorned with frescoes depicting the war between [[../Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] and [[../Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]], featuring the Light and a Death Goddess leading the charge for [[../Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]]. In the foreground, [[../Gods/The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]] was depicted in a dramatic pose, wielding his sword against monstrous adversaries. His breastplate concealed a secret mechanism that, when pressed, opened a passage to an adjoining room containing a replica of his sword, inscribed with the word "Chisel" in Celestial.

Returning to the cave tunnel, which had clearly been shaped by magical means, the group discovered a similarly carved room. Within, they found Cedric using magic to manipulate a barrier. Upon their arrival, he momentarily hesitated as the barrier shimmered, its energy briefly singeing his hair. Cedric, now bearing a gaunt appearance and eyes glowing with an unholy green light, turned to face them, declaring, "You are too late. What lies in the temple is mine."

Their attempts to engage Cedric were thwarted as their attacks were repelled by the barrier. Cedric seized the opportunity to employ a scroll, opening a portal before their eyes. Desperate to gain entry, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] attempted to appeal to [[../Gods/The Grey/Atheca|Atheca]] for assistance but was met with failure. At that moment, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] noticed movement within the tunnel. This unexpected presence turned out to be Snowflake, who led them to Isabella and Farah, who were scouring the forest for the crypt's location. They had also brought with them Laras and the wounded Elric, supported by Laras and Farah.

Isabella examined the weakened barrier and revealed that it had deteriorated over several days. Cedric, it seemed, had struck a dark deal with Aanzor, possibly facilitated by using Isabella's stolen book. His goal was to acquire an artifact known as the Orb of Undeath, believed to reside deep underground within [[../Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] temple of [[../Gods/The Grey/Atheca|Atheca]], behind the barrier.

Isabella informed the group that the gateway would remain open for 24 hours or until Cedric's return. Unlocking the barrier would require her to work through the night. With this information in mind, they decided to rest for eight hours, preparing themselves for the impending battle.
