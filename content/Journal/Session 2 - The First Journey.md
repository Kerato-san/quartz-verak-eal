32nd Khorovel 1524

In the morning, Carceroy goes on a goose chase for meat with skin. Aina sends Akila after him to watch out for him. After Carceroy returns, there are some shenanigans with the scribe as the group wait for Professor Einbach. The group will get more details about our mission when he arrives.

Isabella and Farah were in Waldhein at an Atheca temple looking for possible artifacts. They had reported that there was difficulty in obtaining the correct papers about the history of the village and its surroundings. The group also gets descriptions of the two missing. Isabella is an eccentric magic user and often dressed in extravagant Destanian clothing. Farah is usually dressed in her college clothes from Darhahekim and is not a magician.

The group have two options for travelling to Waldhein. They can go by a sailing ship on the Feld for about a week in the right weather and then follow a side stream on foot for about a day. They can also use horses. That would take between a week and a week and a half. The group chooses to go by boat. Carceroy asks for precise mission objectives. Professor Einbach gives the following objectives:
- return Isabella and Farah safely;
- obtain general information about what has and is happening;
- if an artefact is found, bring it back to Feldenburg.

The group receive a letter to give to the skipper. This skipper is called Elias Vagen. When the group asks the harbour master about him, the group first get the comment "oh, him". He points the group to a two-masted flat-bottomed vessel. The ship looks well maintained and is called the "flying fish". The captain is a man with long blond hair and a big curled moustache. He's clearly a charmer and gives us all a kiss on the hand except Carceroy, who declines. The deckhands are called Bart and Duny.

On the way to our stop in Grundel, Carceroy is busy experimenting, among other things, with the meat and skin he has purchased. Aina tries to make a simple map of the river Felden and Lugh helps with that. In the evenings, Roderik Fremont sings along with the crew and Lugh plays the harp. Near the end of the boat journey, Carceroy suddenly arrives with a flying squirrel named Diodalis.

On the 7th day, the group arrive in Grundel. Aina goes to the local inn called "The Eel Inn" and gets her own room there. The rest go to the local tavern and have a drink together. Diodalis also came to pick up Aina for drinks. The group drink a few things, mostly local wine. While the group has a merry time, Lugh asks around for Isabelle and Farah, but no one has seen them here. However, all locals indicate that fewer outsiders have been seen in the village lately. After some wine tasting, the group go back to the inn or boat to sleep.

The next day, the group leave on foot to Waldhein. In the evening after a day of walking, the group come across a cart along the road with a dead horse. The wheel of the cart is also broken. The group find marks of small clawed hands on the horse after some investigation. There are also footsteps leading into the woods. The footsteps come in two sizes. Aina sends Akila up in the air to look around and she sees something in a tree further into the woods. Aina sneaks into the forest, in the direction of the tree in question. There she finds an unmoving old man lying against a tree, clearly injured. In the tree sits a young man, who clings to the tree with all his might. Under that tree, four small, narrow figures are clawing upward. They are trying to climb the tree.

Aina beckons the others ahead. Alas, they are anything but subtle and they all manage to step on the same branch, which promptly breaks with a loud noise. However, Aina remains silent and has moved a bit away. The noise alerted the four figures and start charging for an attack. The group get into a fight with the sick looking beasts, who turn out to be goblins or used to be goblins. Fortunately, the fight goes well and in the end Aina makes light to signal safety to the man in the tree. Lugh checks the old man, who is fortunately still alive. Their names are Jorn and Horbe. They were on their way to Grundel because Jorn's wife Veigga had been attacked by similar beasts. He describes them as zombie goblins. Since the attack, the woman has been very ill and has a green spot on her arm that won't go away

The man turns out to know Isabelle and Farah. They were indeed in the village. The group travel to Waldhein together. The group pass a number of farms and pastures with sheep. Waldhein itself is a small village with a small church and an old stone tower in the middle. The last orange glow of the sun is cast on the Lenberg hills in the background.
