*10 Sirorev, 1524*

As the group returns to Waldhein, they begin discussing how to distract the guards. Ideas are thrown around, including creating a fake fire or making a loud noise in the church. However, they soon abandon the idea of distraction. They ask Braya to describe Ralph's appearance.

The group decides that [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] will grab the guards guarding the tower from behind while the others create a diversion outside the inn. At dusk, they sneak from the forest into the town, with Braya and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] leading the way. Along the way, Braya prevents [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] from walking into a group of Warriors of [[../Gods/The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]], and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] guides Sir [[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Fremont]] through the dark.

As they approach the inn, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] helps Sir [[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Fremont]] navigate the dark.

The group enters the Inn via the back door and finalizes their plan before [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] move two alleys over to start the ambush. The plan doesn't survive contact with the enemy, but Sir [[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Fremont]] revives it. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] grabs the first guard but struggles to subdue him. Seeing that [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] is needed to succeed there, Sir [[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Fremont]] rushes to the second guard and roughly grabs him, covering his mouth with a heavy gauntlet. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] goes to [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] to finish knocking out their guard. They drag them to the Inn where [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] tie them up.

Afterwards, they sneak into the tower, where they see a hallway with three doors and a twisting stairway going up. As they reach the stairs, a commotion can be heard from the first door to the right.
