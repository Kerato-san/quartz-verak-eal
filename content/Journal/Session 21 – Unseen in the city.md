*20 Sirorev 1524 – 23 Sirorev 1524*

After some strategic deliberation, the group decided to split up, weaving their way separately toward the gate. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] and Suhana opted for a bustling route through the market, their sharp eyes catching sight of several conspicuous figures trying futilely to blend in with the crowd.

[[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]], adopting the guise of a merchant, took a divergent path, accompanied by Saulé. Trailing not far behind [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] and Suhana were [[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Roderick]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]], embodying the roles of formidable mercenaries. Despite a momentary scare near Suhana’s apartment, they managed to converge at the gate without incident. Waiting there was Dr. Gupta, cleverly disguised as an unremarkable elderly man, an owl perched sagely on his shoulder.

Without missing a beat, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] secured a stall for Saulé, parting with 4 gold pieces to ensure his faithful companion’s safety during their absence. Dr. Gupta, meanwhile, arranged for the rental of four robust elephants, their care entrusted to the capable hands of the elephant handler, Summit Panja.

The journey to Ammar Valley unfolded over several days, taking the group through Thaker Crossing, a pivotal juncture where one of Mohanpure’s main arteries branched off in two directions. Their path, however, was clear; veering off toward their true destination, they knew that any tails beyond this point would have unerring knowledge of their trajectory straight to Chamak Valley.

By the fourth day, the group’s vigilance paid off. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]]’s sharp-eyed familiar, Gramps, intercepted a rose-ringed parakeet, abruptly ending its flight—and its role as another’s familiar. Its role became clear when it vanished into thin air when it was killed. The deceased bird carried a stone marked with a carved mouth which fell out of the sky when it vanished. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] discerned it was radiating evocation magic, an ominous sign.

Approaching the critical crossing, Akila’s keen senses discerned an anomaly, a tamed elephant amidst a herd of its wild kin. With cautious steps, the group neared the junction, only for [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]]’s alert eyes to catch sight of an elephant-borne assailant hiding in the bushes, wasting no time in launching an attack.
