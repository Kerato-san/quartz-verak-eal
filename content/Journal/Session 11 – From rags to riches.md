*10 and 11 Sirorev 1524*

A figure in rags dashes into the inn across the street, which [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] see from the window. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] asks Elanil to watch the inn while he and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] try to get a good look around from the roof. The stairs end in a rusty, creaky trapdoor. Once they're through, the roof has a rough, uneven surface and partial walls remaining from the floor that was destroyed centuries ago.

Akila flies stealthily around the inn to look for the strange figure. She sees a pile of rags in one of the rooms facing the tower. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] then goes to look for the Warriors, who they knocked out when they were in the inn previously. While [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] futilely asks the others if anyone knows who it could be, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] finds the prisoners’ belongings and grabs the inn key.

[[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] uses duplicity, an illusory copy of himself, behind the tower as a distraction and to kill some zombies. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] goes out front to the inn but finds that the front door is barricaded, so she has to go around back. Once inside, she manages to calm the intruder, who turns out to be Henry, one of the Warriors trying to get to the tower to help his comrades.

As the group's distraction ended, the Warriors rushed across the road, but the sound of the barricade by the inn’s front door being pushed around had attracted some zombies. Luckily they managed to get inside in time. They tried to get some rest in the mayor's office on the first floor, but [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] was subjected to a dark nightmare filled with zombies, which left him exhausted. Other townfolk had very similar nightmares where they fell underground and got chased by horrible zombies in underground caverns. The experience is weird and unnerving.

The next morning, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] woke up before [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] and found some letters incriminating Cedric and Ralph in the zombie attacks. Ralph thought this would give him more power and riches. The search also uncovered some books about the founding of Waldhein and the existence of a previous fort named Waldhart, both of which were after the fall of the temple. The stone tower and inn were the only stone buildings in the town and were likely part of the fort.

After a breakfast of what little food they had, the group gathered some equipment from the armoury.

[[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] receives a message from Farah and Isabella, urging the group to go find something on the Northern hill. As they prepare for their journey, Henry, Elric, and Dunsten step forward, offering to help the group convince the Warriors and villagers to work together. The group prepares them to convince the Warriors and the villagers to work together with the evidence that was found before setting off.

Their journey is fraught with danger, as they sneak through alleys, jump fences, and pick locks to avoid the ever-present zombies. The group moves like shadows, their movements quick and silent, their senses alert for any sign of danger.

Their stealthy approach lasts until the edge of town. As they stand in the eerie stillness of the dimly lit street, the sounds of shuffling feet and moans of the undead echo through the air, sending shivers down their spines. The group is surrounded by a horde of zombies, with more emerging from the alleyway ahead, their decomposing bodies drawing ever closer.

[[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Roderick]], ever the quick thinker, sees their dire situation and comes up with a daring plan. With a glint in his eye, he reaches into his bag and pulls out a bottle. In a bold move, he hurls it down the dark alley, hoping to draw the zombies away from the group and buy them some time to make a break for safety.

But fate seems to be against them as the bottle shatters at their feet, attracting the attention of the relentless zombies. The group watches in horror as [[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Roderick]] fumbles, his daring plan quickly turning into a nightmare. The horde of zombies turn their attention towards the source of the noise, their shuffling footsteps growing louder, closer, as they advance upon the group.

The group draws their weapons, steeling themselves for the fight of their lives.
