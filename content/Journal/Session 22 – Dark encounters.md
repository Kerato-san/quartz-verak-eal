*23 Sirorev 1524 â€“ 28 Sirorev 1524*

The scene is set in a frenzy, with the thunderous charge of an elephant acting as the herald of an imminent confrontation. Emerging from the opposite side of the crossing, adversaries draped in shadows spring forth from their hidden vantage among the foliage. From within their ranks, a dark-robed sorcerer weaves an incantation, resulting in a menacing black sphere that engulfs [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]], Suhana, and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]]. Within, ethereal entities hunger for their essence.

Breaking free, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] takes to the air, quickly spotting a downed foe. His attention then sharply shifts to the sorcerer responsible for the sphere of void. As steel clashes and spells fly, the group battles with tenacity and determination. Their enemies are formidable, but not indomitable. Among the remnants of the defeated, they discover another stone etched with a familiar carved mouth, the twins to the previous one. Claiming the enchanted sending stones, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]] keep them as prized trophies.

Their journey resumes with the addition of four elephants to their convoy. The town of Nandipur soon welcomes them, its silhouette stretching against the horizon. There, an agile woman named Asha Bakshi, armored in native leathers, leaps gracefully from a rooftop. Her initial suspicion dissipates upon learning of Dr. Gupta's presence, and she leads them to Raji, the village elder.

Raji entrusts the group's guidance to his nephew, Kavi, who promises a path once believed to be a resting place for dragons. But caution is advised, as the route is laced with predatory six-legged felines and treacherous flora.

As dawn graces the next day, they embark on their expedition into the valley's heart. However, as night's shroud envelops the land, an eerie sound of clicking teeth reverberates around them. The forest's eyes, luminescent in a ghostly green, fixate on them. The culprits? Displacer beasts. Although the ensuing combat is strenuous, the group prevails. But in the aftermath, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Roderick]], disoriented, vanishes into the jungle's embrace.

[[../Characters/Player Characters/Megan Wattson|Megan]], while equipping Gramps with a leg band, discovers an inscribed note, hinting at their being observed and potentially trailed. Meanwhile, Akila locates the missing [[../Characters/Player Characters/Roderick Fremont|Roderick]], who is ensnared amidst venomous blooms. With collective effort, they rescue him, but the effects of the toxins linger, necessitating urgent medical attention.
