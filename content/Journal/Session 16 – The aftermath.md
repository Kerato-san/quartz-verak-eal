_11 Sirorev 1524_

Upon their return to Larras and Elric at the entrance, they noticed the sounds of returning animals and wilted flowers starting to bloom once again. At [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]]'s feet, entire flower bushes sprung up, hinting at his fey history. As they made their way back to Waldhein, Diodaris scouted ahead, revealing that the townspeople were engaged in the clean-up following the zombie ordeal. However, there was no sign of Saulé where they had left her. Thankfully, there was no indication of her demise either.

They moved through the town unopposed, witnessing people laying bodies in the main square and covering them with whatever cloth they could find. Zombie corpses still littered the town. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] and Roderick placed Cedric's body among the deceased, while Isabella and Farah tended to the wounded. Seeing that the situation was well in hand, they headed to the tower to check on Veigga and possibly find Jorn and Horbe there as well. On their way, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] spotted a figure hastily galloping out of town on horseback.

When they reached the tower, they found Veigga, who was alive but weak. All signs of corruption had vanished. With the last of [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]]'s abilities, he healed her slightly to facilitate her recovery in more comfortable surroundings. Dunston was overseeing operations in the square, so they approached him to ask about the rider [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] had observed leaving town and any sightings of Saulé. Saulé hadn't been seen, but Dunston recognized [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]]'s description of the horse as his fastest steed, which he hadn't loaned out. Using his newfound ability to speak with animals, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] acquired a description of the rider from the horse in the stall next to the empty one. Dunston believed that the description most likely matched Sander, the tavern keeper, although it could also fit two farmers.

In the tavern, Henry and some Warriors of [[../Gods/The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]] informed them that Sander hadn't been seen for about half an hour. Upon inspecting Sander's quarters, they found signs of a ransacking and potential looting. They sent an animal messenger to Elias, hoping to intercept Sander at the docks. [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] and Roderick remained in town to assist with the ongoing efforts, while [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] and [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] set out to find Saulé, who, luckily, was unharmed when they located her. By evening, most of the bodies had been cleared away, and the town began to transform into a part-wake, part-"we survived" party with food, fire, and music. Braya, still in her leather armour and bearing her crossbow, proudly recounted her role in stopping the zombies.

The following morning, [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] suggested to Isabella and Farah that they should either restore the altar of [[../Gods/The Grey/Timnar|Timnar]] or establish a shrine to [[../Gods/The Grey/Atheca|Atheca]], offering the town some protection. In a side conversation with Larras, he also suggested a shrine to [[../Gods/The Grey/Nethin|Nethin]] as a precaution. They bid their farewells, with [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] promising to return and say hello if they ever passed through the area again. After a brief visit to Veigga, who was recovering nicely, they departed for the docks, where they noticed Dunston's horse safely stabled at the farrier.
