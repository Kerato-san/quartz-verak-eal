*10 Sirorev 1524*

The group wakes up to a new day, with [[../Characters/Player Characters/Gideon Benicio Montague Carceroy|Gideon]] showing up with some weird flaps on his armour.  
They discuss comradeship and how there can be no debt between us. It was surprising to learn for [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] that the rest of the group already considered him a friend.

After a lengthy conversation with Farah and Isabella regarding their wards and alarms, in order to ensure they could contact them again later, they decide to part ways. Farah and Isabella focus on locating the exact location of [[../Gods/The Grey/Atheca|Atheca]]â€™s temple and discovering Cedric's plans, while the group returns to Waldhein.

On the way, the group discovers the burnt corpses of the zombies they had previously defeated still in place. Near Waldhein, Braya calls out softly to them from a tree. She informs them that Ralph, after what seems to be a mental message or command, has rounded up everybody they talked to in town and locked them in the tower. The group has to make a decision: go to the tower or try to find the temple first. In the end, they decide to try and find the temple first, but to save time, they can't avoid the town completely.

The group follows the edge of the forest, with [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] disguised as Cedric using a spell. Braya wears one of the cleaned goblin armors, while [[../Characters/Player Characters/Ainalucia Julieta Adriana Loracan|Aina]] walks ahead in the forest.

[[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]] manages to convince a patrol to delay warning Ralph, but they require an escort to the church. After leaving the church via the back entrance, the group heads to the forested hill.

On the way, they find tracks that are around two or three days old, consistent with the time Cedric was last seen. These tracks aren't present at the top of the hill. From the top, they see some people walking around near the church.

The group continued down the hill, searching for any sign of Cedric or his robes. Despite [[../Characters/Player Characters/Lugh Aynurdaris|Lugh]]'s attempts at a finding spell, they found nothing. Akila did note that a strong smell of rot surrounded the hill, with the stench being strongest at the top.
