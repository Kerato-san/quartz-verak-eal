**TAVERN ENTERTAINMENT**

Characters with a talent for music, storytelling, or other forms of entertainment might seek to share their gifts with tavern patrons in exchange for coin and acclaim.

**Resources.** This activity requires access to a tavern willing to allow the character to perform. The character should have an instrument, a set of performers' tools, or other necessary equipment. The activity takes one workweek of time.

**FINDING AND SECURING GIGS**

To find an establishment willing to host a performance, a character makes an Investigation check. Once a suitable venue is found, the character must then persuade the owner or manager to hire them, requiring a Persuasion check.

| **Establishment Type** | **DC to Find** | **DC to Get Hired** |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Dive Bar               | 5              | 8                   |
| Local Tavern           | 10             | 12                  |
| Renowned Inn           | 15             | 16                  |
| Noble's Feast Hall     | 20             | 20                  |

**Resolution.** At the end of the workweek, the character makes a Performance check (Charisma). The total of the check determines the earnings and audience reception, as shown on the Tavern Entertainment table.

**ESTABLISHMENT VALUE**

Before the character can perform, determine the value and renown of the establishment. You can decide this based on the setting and narrative, or roll randomly using the table below:

|**Establishment Type**|**Base Earnings**|
|---|---|
|Dive Bar|5 gp|
|Local Tavern|10 gp|
|Renowned Inn|20 gp|
|Noble's Feast Hall|50 gp|

**TAVERN ENTERTAINMENT REWARDS**

|**Check Total**|**Multiplier**|**Result**|
|---|---|---|
|1–10|x0.5|The performance was below average.|
|11–15|x1|The audience seemed entertained.|
|16–20|x2|The audience was thrilled, asking for encores.|
|21+|x3|You're the talk of the establishment, with patrons requesting your return.|

Multiply the character's check result multiplier by the base earnings of the establishment to determine the week's earnings.

**SCRIBE WORK**

Characters skilled in the written word can find work as scribes, documenting information, transcribing texts, and even penning letters for those less literate. The renown of the workplace can affect both the availability of jobs and the compensation for them.

---

|**Establishment Type**|**DC to Find**|**DC to Get Hired**|
|---|---|---|
|Street Corner Stand|5|8|
|Town's Library|10|12|
|City's Record Hall|15|16|
|Royal Archives|20|20|

---

**Finding Work:** Characters can seek out opportunities to work as scribes. Depending on where they look, they might have different challenges:

- **Street Corner Stand:** Setting up or finding a simple stand where locals might need letters written or documents read.
- **Town's Library:** A place where books are kept and often where local scholars might need help transcribing or cataloging texts.
- **City's Record Hall:** A larger establishment where official city records are kept, and where accuracy and speed are highly valued.
- **Royal Archives:** The pinnacle of a scribe's career, working with ancient texts, royal decrees, and secret documents of utmost importance.

**Getting Hired:** Once a workplace is found, the character must convince the establishment of their skill and reliability. This might involve showcasing past work, providing references, or even taking a small test of their abilities.

**Getting Paid:** Payment varies based on the renown of the establishment.

---

**Payment Table for Scribe Work:**

|**Establishment Type**|**Base Earnings per Week**|**Success Multiplier**|
|---|---|---|
|Street Corner Stand|5 gp|0.5x|
|Town's Library|10 gp|1x|
|City's Record Hall|20 gp|1.5x|
|Royal Archives|50 gp|2x|

---

**Earnings Resolution:** After securing a job, a character's earnings are determined by their quality of work, represented by a series of checks:

- The character makes three checks related to their scribe work: Intelligence (Investigation) for researching, Wisdom (Insight) for understanding the intent behind the texts, and Dexterity for the actual writing/transcribing process.
- Depending on the total number of successful checks (those meeting or exceeding the DC to Get Hired for the establishment):

- **0 successes:** The character earns nothing and might even face repercussions for shoddy work.
- **1 success:** The character earns the base rate for the establishment.
- **2 successes:** The character earns the base rate multiplied by the Success Multiplier.
- **3 successes:** The character earns double the base rate multiplied by the Success Multiplier.

For instance, a character working at the City's Record Hall with 2 successes would earn 20 gp * 1.5 = 30 gp for that week.

---

**Complications:** Scribe work, while seemingly straightforward, can come with its own unique challenges.
