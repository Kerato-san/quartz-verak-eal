*32 Sirorev 1524 – 8 Larum 1524*

In a strategic move to safeguard the Dragon’s Heart, Lugh suggests that Megan attune to the artifact. This suggestion arises from the fresco they had seen earlier, where the Heart seemed to be bound to the wielder's wrist, making it more difficult for potential thieves to snatch.

As Megan begins the process of attunement, an ethereal form resembling a wyrmling red dragon emerges from the Heart. It nods towards Megan, an action that seems to signify the completion of its task or a transfer of guardianship.

An hour into the attunement, the Dragon’s Heart begins to levitate, then embeds itself in Megan’s right wrist when he extends his hands. A transformation ensues, with bronze scales proliferating from the point of attachment, eventually covering his entire arm with the likeness of a bronze dragonborn. To conceal these changes from the rest, Megan wraps his arm in bandages before rejoining the group to allocate the rest of the loot.

Lugh decides to share his knowledge of Fae etiquette with the group, considering their recent encounter. Meanwhile, Suhana and Aina engage in a private discussion, and Megan establishes a signal with Oko for the eventual return of the Heart.

Their journey back through the jungle is aided by the use of a rope, ensuring their safe passage. Upon reaching the village, they find no signs of suspicious activity and assist Summit Panja in preparing the elephants for departure.

On their way, they encounter a caravan of camels led by two handlers. Megan's observant eye picks up on the similarity between the handlers' attire and the outfits of the guards from the groups they had previously combated. As these supposed minions engage the group in a seemingly innocuous trade discussion. If Megan hadn’t picked up on the clues, they wouldn’t have known they were part of the same group.

In a surprising and swift maneuver, Aina, donning the robes of one of the enemy leaders, emerges unexpectedly behind the minions. Her clever disguise sows confusion among them, leading to their swift surrender.

The group quickly devises a strategy to handle the situation. They decide to send the minions off to a different city, marking their mission as a failure. Meanwhile, the rest of the group plans to head towards Mohanpura. The arrangement is for Summit and Lugh to wait with the elephants and most of the newly 'acquired' camels for an hour at a safe distance from the city. The others, each taking one camel, would advance ahead.

Lugh also makes the difficult decision to sell Saulé in Mohanpura, ensuring the animal’s safety, a choice that weighs heavily on him. Disguised, Lugh successfully manages the transactions for both the rented and the newly 'acquired' animals.

Remaining in disguise, he takes to the skies, flying directly towards the portalis. His aerial approach is a strategic move to avoid detection and to swiftly reunite with the rest of the group, who are waiting at the portalis, ready for their next steps.

In this latest venture through the portalis, only Suhana, Roderick, and Aina experience any discomfort, each becoming nauseous from the teleportation. Once they have sufficiently recovered, the group proceeds to the University. Along the way, Megan discreetly broaches the subject of what they intend to do with the artifact they've acquired.

Upon their arrival at the University, they encounter Ralph, who promptly excuses himself to summon Professor Einbach. Aina, ever curious, takes a quick glance at the papers Ralph had been working on, noting they appear to be some sort of academic essay.

When Professor Einbach arrives, the group relays the details of their recent adventures, including their acquisition of the artifact. In the professor's office, they take the opportunity to test the artifact. To their astonishment, a tiny bronze dragon hatchling materializes, speaking only in Draconic. Aina steps in to translate between the hatchling and Megan.

The hatchling, it is revealed, is summoned from the heart of the artifact and will remain 'anchored' to it as long as Megan is attuned. Intriguingly, it is Megan's dragon, suggesting that the artifact would summon a different dragon for another individual, even if they chose the same elements as Megan. The hatchling requires a name, a task that falls to Megan. He chooses 'Krazika,' a name inspired by Elder Krazik. This new presence, however, seems to stir a hint of jealousy in Archimedes.

The group, having wrapped up their discussions with Professor Einbach, decides to visit Gideon and introduce Megan to him. Upon their arrival, they find Gideon deeply engrossed in his work on an Identifier apparatus, a project that has evidently caused him to forget both lunch and dinner.

Opting for a change of scenery and a chance to catch up, they all head to the Stained Parchment inn for dinner. The meal takes an amusing turn when Megan purchases raw meat, raising eyebrows, especially from Gideon. The moment of confusion is swiftly resolved as Megan indicates that the raw meat is intended for Krazika, his newly acquired dragon hatchling.

After dinner, the group embarks on a shopping excursion, visiting Zia’s Emporium and the "Midnight Anvil" smithy. These ventures are not just for purchasing new items; they also take the opportunity to offload some of the bounty they had collected but found no need for.
