## Rusalka Mariya
### Rusalka Mariya’s Background
**Description:** Mariya is a hauntingly beautiful yet sorrowful figure with flowing white hair, pale skin, and eyes like deep pools of water. She wears a dress made of frozen water lilies and moves with an ethereal grace. Bound by Baba Mavra, Mariya is used as a source of power for the witch. The corruption spreading from the Frozen Bride gives Mariya prophetic dreams, which add to her tragic allure.

**Motivation:** Mariya was betrayed and drowned by a lover, binding her spirit to the lake. She desires freedom from her curse but is wary of mortals due to her tragic past.

**Personality:** Melancholic and very wary, yet capable of kindness and gratitude. She harbours a deep-seated sorrow but can be fiercely protective of her domain.

**Habits:** Mariya spends her time singing mournful songs by the lake, weaving water lilies into intricate patterns, and watching over the creatures of the water.
#### Interaction 1: Free the Rusalka
**Request:** The adventurers must break the curse binding Mariya to the lake. This requires a ritual involving rare ingredients and a personal sacrifice.

**Ingredients Required:**
Possible:
Blood of a Noble Stag
Hair of a Maiden
Magic blood 

**Moral Dilemma:**
- The ritual involves an emotional and possibly traumatic experience for one of the adventurers.
- The ingredients may require them to desecrate a burial site or undertake a perilous journey at night.

**Boon:**
- **Blessing of the Lake:** Mariya grants the adventurers a protective charm that shields them from harmful water-based magic and improves their navigation in water.
- **Secret Knowledge:** Mariya reveals a hidden underwater entrance to Castle Czernobog, bypassing many of the defences.
- **Guidance:** Mariya provides crucial information about the Frozen Bride’s divine slumber and how to awaken her.

**Bane:**
- **Anger of the Witch:** Freeing Mariya enrages Baba Mavra, who loses a source of power. She may retaliate against the adventurers and the village.
- **Haunted Memories:** The emotional toll of the ritual leaves the affected adventurer with lingering sorrow, affecting their morale and decision-making.

### Interaction 2: Seek Prophecy

**Request:**
Mariya, bound by prophetic dreams, can offer a vision of the Frozen Bride's life, but it comes at a cost.

**What the Group Must Give:**
- **A Personal Memory:** Each adventurer must sacrifice a cherished memory, which will be lost to them forever. This is a deeply personal and emotional sacrifice.

 **Boon:**
- **Prophetic Memory:** Mariya provides a detailed vision of a crucial moment in the Frozen Bride's life. The vision reveals that the Frozen Bride, named Yelena, was a divine guardian who sacrificed herself to protect the land from a great evil. She was placed in slumber by the gods to preserve her essence until the land could be healed.
    - **Vision of the Past:** The adventurers see the moment of Yelena's sacrifice, learning about the divine magic used to put her in slumber. They learn that a specific incantation and a relic of purity are needed to awaken her.
    - **Key Insight:** The vision also reveals a hidden weakness in Sergei Dmitri Petrovich, linked to his obsession with Yelena, which the adventurers can exploit in their final battle.

**Bane:**
- **Lost Memories:** The loss of cherished memories can affect the adventurers’ personalities and relationships, creating inner conflict and emotional turmoil.
- **Mystic Repercussions:** The act of seeking prophecy may draw unwanted attention from other malevolent forces sensitive to such magic.

- **Strengthened Resolve:** The adventurers gain confidence and resolve from their victory, boosting their morale.
