# History
The history of Verak’eal has been divided into five ages by historians. The ages are a rough division of the global social and political landscape over time. The ages are rough and might not be entirely representative of some local areas. In some places, the aged might have started a bit sooner or later. Some historians might contest the division altogether. This division, however, is the one that is popular among the common folk who might know a little about history.

## Age of Gods
The Age of Gods is the time before the world existed as it does now. It was a single reality which was warped in many ways. The stories of this age are mostly myths and stories though some parts have been proven to be true. In the Age of Gods, gods walked the earth. They lived in harmony with each other and with the mortals that would eventually walk the earth too. Eventually, some gods became corrupt and corrupted those around them. These gods are named [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]]. This resulted in a war against them. The gods that fought [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] are called [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]].

## The Shatter
[[./The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]] is the event that ended the Age of Gods. It is the conclusion of the war between [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] and [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]]. [[./Gods/The Grey Pantheon|The Grey]] came up with a plan to and the war and end the suffering it caused. The plan was to break the realm in many different planes. It would move planes of the god farthest away from the material plane. The break was imprecise but successful. This event came to be known as [[./The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]]. In [[./The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], [[./Gods/The Lost Pantheon|The Lost]] were banished to the lower planes where they are prisoners to their planes. The other gods take residents on other outer planes where they can still influence the material plane, but their influence is contained.

## Age of Discovery
After [[./The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], the mortals who walked the earth had to readjust to the new realm they lived in. They had to adjust to a world with less influence of the gods. That is why this age is characterised by discovery. Civilizations slowly spread around the world.

## Age of Sovereigns
After an age of discovering and settling. The first formal countries started to form. In the previous age, people settled and started to form civilisation under leadership. In the Age of Sovereigns, these civilisations slowly but surely grew into to empires.

## Age of Conquest
In the Age of Conquest, the empires grew too large and started to fall apart in wars. The Age of Conquest is characterised by many wars. In this age, the most of the current borders arose when the wars ended, and from the fractured empires most of the current countries arose.

## Age of Stability
The world is currently in age with relatively few wars. Most countries have stable relations. That is not to say that they are on the best of terms or that there haven’t been any wars. Because of the relative stability of this age compared to the other times since [[./The Shatter and The War of The Shatter|The Shatter]], this age has been called the Age of Stability.
