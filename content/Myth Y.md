Mother: Irina Milkovna
Brother: Nikolai

Yelena, the firstborn of Lord Boris and Lady Irina, is a disciple of Serah, the Goddess of Love. Her beauty and grace are known throughout the land. Alexei, a víla of Nedarin, falls deeply in love with her

Yelena’s younger brother, Nikolai, covets the position of the heir. He conspires with Nethira, the Goddess of Deceit, who appears to him in dreams. Vladimir, driven by ambition, releases a venomous serpent into Yelena’s garden.

Yelena, beloved by the villagers for her kindness, is bitten by a venomous serpent while picking flowers near the castle. Alexei, who has been secretly watching her, rushes to her aid. As she lies dying, he encounters a figure who appears to be Nedarin but is actually Nethira in disguise. Nethira suggests using an icicle from the glacier to freeze Yelena and halt the venom's spread.

Desperate to save his beloved, Alexei performs the ritual, freezing Yelena in a state of suspended animation. He believes he has saved her, but the ritual binds her soul in a state between life and death. Meanwhile, Nikolai celebrates his sister’s downfall, having been manipulated by Nethira into orchestrating the serpent’s attack. The land begins to wither, and a curse settles over the castle and village.

As Yelena lies frozen, the land around Castle Zelenýhrad begins to wither and corrupt, a side effect of the dark magic. Vladimir, seeing his plan partly succeed, is tormented by guilt and the realization that Nethira has tricked him. He slowly turns into a tyrant.
