# History
The history of Verak’eal has been divided into five ages by historians. The ages are a rough division of the global social and political landscape over time. The ages are rough and might not be entirely representative of some local areas. In some places, the aged might have started a bit sooner or later. Some historians might contest the division altogether. This division, however, is the one that is popular among the common folk who might know a little about history.

## Age of Gods
The Age of Gods is the time before the world existed as it does now. It was a single reality which was warped in many ways. The stories of this age are mostly myths and stories though some parts have been proven to be true. In the Age of Gods, gods walked the earth. They lived in harmony with each other and with the mortals that would eventually walk the earth too. Eventually, some gods became corrupt and corrupted those around them. These gods are named The Lost. This resulted in a war against them. The gods that fought the lost are called The Grey.

## The Shatter
The Shatter is the event that ended the Age of Gods. It is the conclusion of the war between The Grey and The Lost. The Grey came up with a plan to and the war and end the suffering it caused. The plan was to break the realm in many different planes. It would move planes of the god farthest away from the material plane. The break was imprecise but successful. This event came to be known as the Shatter. In the Shatter, the Lost were banished to the lower planes where they are prisoners to their planes. The other gods take residents on other outer planes where they can still influence the material plane, but their influence is contained.

## Age of Discovery
After the Shatter, the mortals who walked the earth had to readjust to the new realm they lived in. They had to adjust to a world with less influence of the gods. That is why this age is characterised by discovery. Civilizations slowly spread around the world.

## Age of Sovereigns
After an age of discovering and settling. The first formal countries started to form. In the previous age, people settled and started to form civilisation under leadership. In the Age of Sovereigns, these civilisations slowly but surely grew into to empires.

## Age of Conquest
In the Age of Conquest, the empires grew too large and started to fall apart in wars. The Age of Conquest is characterised by many wars. In this age, the most of the current borders arose when the wars ended, and from the fractured empires most of the current countries arose.

## Age of Stability
The world is currently in age with relatively few wars. Most countries have stable relations. That is not to say that they are on the best of terms or that there haven’t been any wars. Because of the relative stability of this age compared to the other times since the Shatter, this age has been called the Age of Stability.

# Deities

The world of Verak'eal has many deities that are worshipped. Legend tells that they once walked among the mortals in the God Age. The realm was singular warped and endless. In this landscape, the power of the gods of evil grew stronger, and their influence spread. These gods of evil are often called the Lost. The other god grew restless of the power the Lost gained. Slowly more and more war and strife started to break out against the Lost.

When the wars became very intense, Dathin and the Raven Queen came up with a plan. They saw that the influence of all gods, good and evil, were making the people suffer. The war had to end, and the influence of the gods had to be contained. They came up with a plan to contain the powers of the gods and started gathering forces.

Many gods also saw that the war would eventually lead to utter destruction and joined their cause, forming a faction of gods labelled the Grey. Some needed a bit more convincing and eventually joined. When the Lost got wind of the plan, they started to give it their all in one last battle. In this battle, the plan succeeded.

The plan was to break the realm in many different planes. The gods would end up on the planes farthest away from the material plane where most life would reside. The break was imprecise but successful. This event came to be known as the Shatter.

In the Shatter, the Lost were banished to the lower planes where they are prisoners to their planes. The other gods take residents on other outer planes where they can still influence the material plane, but their influence is contained.

# Religion

Though the gods are a fact of reality and can be proven to exist, religion is not homogenous. Different cultures can have different religious customs and originations, and different organisations can have different sects.  The beliefs of the god often also give room to different interpretations.

While the worship of the gods is widespread in the world of Vrak'eal other forms of religion, do exist. People can worship many things like demigods, spirits, angels, devils, demons, and other powerful entities.

# The Grey

The Grey is the main pantheon of god that is worshipped by most cultures.

# Atheca

Goddess of Magic

Chaotic Neutral

Atheca is the goddess who gave mortals the knowledge on how to do magic without relying on gods to do so. Mortals started using these arcane magics instead of divine magics, much to the dismay of some other gods. Many of whom tried to erase this knowledge but never succeeding. While other gods might think magic could lead mortals astray, Atheca does not believe that it is magic that leads people astray.

Her followers follow these commandments:

# Sheleth

God of Art – Creator of the Elves

Chaotic Good

Sheleth is the god who tries to put beauty in all there is. A life without beauty is a life worth living. This led him to create elves. According to legends, they formed the first elves with raw magic, forming them close to their likeness. They then gave them life with a drop of their own blood. Their blood made them seemingly immortal, but after the Shatter, the elves all began to age. Though their immortality has faded, they still have a lifespan of centuries, a gift seemingly coming from Sheleth's blood. Though they created the elves in their likeness, they made them able to reproduce and grow like other life that started to sprout and grow at that time. That is the beauty of life according to Sheleth. That is why unlike Sheleth, the elves have sexes.

While many elves worship Sheleth because they are of their blood, many artists of different disciplines worship them as well. They let Sheleth guide to bring beauty to all what they do.

Their followers follow these commandments:
- Create, inspire, and find beauty in all that you do, whether you’re casting a spell, composing a saga, strumming a lute, or practising the arts of war.

# Varida

The Stone Mother - Goddess of Forge and Stone

Lawful good

Varida is the goddess who prefers to live underground. The stone there is what gives her power. There she mastered the art of the forge and stone. Sculpting her home under the mountains and turning ore into the most brilliant armour and weapons. Allies of her were sure to be well equipped. Though she had allies, she grew lonely underneath the earth. She then chiselled a counterpart for herself, small sturdy and strong like herself.  Then in a ritual, she syphoned the power of the stone around her into the statue, turning it into the first dwarf, Tordas. He helped her with the forge and kept her company. Varida did not expect to fall in love with her creation, but she did. She confessed her love to Tordas. He confessed he felt the same way and showed her an armour he was working on for her. In return, Varida gave him her anvil. From there union, the race of dwarves was born.

Her followers follow these commandments:
- Forge and sculpt for the good of all.
- Embrace the earth, it grants you strength and honour.
- Value those around you, for an army is stronger than a soldier.

# The Lost

Though the gods where banished and confined to their own evil realms in the shatter, they still try and influence the mortal world and try to claw their way out of their forsaken realms. Many of those ploys have been averted and dealt with. The moral realms are safe from them, for now.

They do however still have followers hidden out of sight. Hidden sects and temples where these gods are worshipped.

Fax

God of Domination

Lawful Evil

Fax is a god with a simple goal; domination over all. Turn others into subjects and make them follow every command. Make sure no one dares to rebel. Followers of Fax share this goal and hope they get a place in his ranks when he will eventually rise.

His followers follow these commandments:
- Assert dominance and power over others. Show your strength of will in the image of the Lord.
- Repay cruelty done unto you with further evil. If others show you kindness, exploit it.
- As you ascend to power, do not pity or show mercy to those you climb over to get there. Compassion is unwarranted for the weak.

# Hekoda

God of Hatred

Neutral Evil

Hekoda is one of the more primal fallen gods. His power comes from the rage and hatred he has for everyone who stands against him. He only allows the strong that stand with him to keep living. The weak need to be purged. In his eyes, the only path to strength is through to primal force of hatred. 

His followers follow these commandments:
- Ruin. Conquer. Kill.

# Lolth

Empress of Spiders – Matron of Drow

Chaotic Evil

Once a good friend of Sheleth, she became the goddess of elven destiny. However, legends tell the tale of how she grew to want more power. Especially since in her eyes, Sheleth gave the elves too much freedom. She slowly began to seduce more and more elves to follow her until eventually, Sheleth noticed that the beauty in the lives of some elves began to grow corrupt. Tracing this influence to Lolth, Sheleth cursed and banished her. Lolth form grew spider-like, and she crawled underneath the earth. The elves that follow her would follow her there to the Underdark where the Underdark would corrupt them and turn them into the dark elves, the drow. The drow kept Lolth as their patron deity.

Her followers follow these commandments:
- It is better to be loved than feared, but you may certainly try to be both.
- Misdirection, slander, and shadowed steps have more function than direct conflict.
- Death to the elves who live under the sun. Death to all their allies!

# Namiut

Goddess of Evil Dragons

Lawful Evil

Namiut once formed a pair with Mahatu. She thought he showed weakness when he wanted to protect the innocent where she saw an opportunity to gain power. She then became the evil dragon deity of the two. She is a vain and proud goddess who seeks to take power where she can.

Her followers follow these commandments:
- Amass wealth, and spend little. The gold, and the power that comes with it, is sufficient reward.
- Do not forgive nor forget an indignity to yourself. Let no affront go unpunished.
- Take what you covet. Those without the strength to defend their dominion are not worthy to have a dominion.

# Nethira

Goddess of Deceit

Chaotic Evil

Nethira’s legacy is hulled in many contradicting legends, but all speak of her skill in deception and manipulation, climbing to power through her very lies. Nethira is hulled in mystery. Nobody seems to know who what her true goals are, only that she loves deception and that is why nobody knows.

Her followers follow these commandments:
- Keep your acts obfuscated and secret. Revealing your true self is weakness. The night is your greatest ally.

God of Destruction

Chaotic Evil

Pentath is a god he finds bliss in turning things into nothing. Some of his followers prophesize that he will be the one who will end it all once he is free. They believe Pentath escape will be the beginning of the Epoch of Ends. While some doubt the validity of these prophesies, they are enough to strike fear into the heart of others.

- Only build something to destroy something else.
- Ruin and raze the realms to prepare for the Epoch of Ends.

# Wendel

God of Greed

Neutral Evil

Wendel was a god who owned an immense amount of wealth in various forms before the shatter. Though he had so much, it was never enough for him. It wasn’t owning things that gave him joy but gaining them.

His followers follow these commandments:
- Acquire wealth and power wherever you can.
- Take what you can, those without the strength to cling on to their belongings are not worthy of keeping them.
- Keep your wealth safe, be wary of others who might try to take it from you.

- Seek and exalt places where no light touches.
- Revel in the pain you inflict upon others, and relish the pain you suffer yourself as an offering to the Xiloth.
- Imprison those who cannot resist you, and drag all life into the darkness.
