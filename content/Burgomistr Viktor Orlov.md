### **Burgomistr Viktor Orlov: Overview**

**Description:** Viktor Orlov is a stern and imposing figure, a man of late middle age with greying hair, a thick moustache, and sharp, calculating eyes. He dresses in fine but slightly worn clothes, hinting at the fading wealth of the town. He has served as the Burgomistr of Zelenýhrad for decades, during which time the village has seen both prosperity and decline. Orlov is a man deeply burdened by the curse that grips the town, but his authority and strong sense of duty keep him from showing any sign of weakness.

**Motivation:** Viktor is deeply devoted to Zelenýhrad and its people, though his methods can be harsh. He is aware of the town’s dark history and the curse that binds its inhabitants, but he keeps much of this knowledge to himself, fearing panic or worse consequences if the truth were known. His primary goal is to find a way to lift the curse while maintaining order in the village.

**Personality:** Viktor is pragmatic, authoritative, and often gruff, but not without compassion. He is haunted by the secrets he keeps and the difficult choices he must make to protect the town. He can be distrustful of outsiders, especially those who pry too deeply into the village’s mysteries.

**Habits:** Viktor is often seen walking through the village, checking on the well-being of the townsfolk, or locked away in his office, poring over old records and correspondences. He spends many nights pacing the floor, unable to sleep, burdened by the weight of his responsibilities.

### Viktor Orlov Overview

**Description:**  
Viktor Orlov is the Burgomistr (mayor) of Zelenýhrad, a man caught between his duty to the town and his fear of Lord Sergei Dmitri Petrovich. He is a stern and imposing figure, with greying hair, a thick moustache, and sharp, calculating eyes that reveal a man weighed down by heavy burdens. Though he dresses in fine clothes befitting his status, they are slightly worn, reflecting the fading prosperity of Zelenýhrad under Sergei’s dark rule. Viktor’s voice is deep and measured, but there is an underlying tension in his words, as though he is constantly guarding his thoughts.

**Motivation:**  
Viktor is driven by a sense of duty to protect the town and its people, but his loyalty to Sergei is enforced by fear. He knows too much about the horrors that lie within Castle Czernobog, and this knowledge has made him a puppet for the vampire lord. Viktor desperately wants to break free from Sergei’s control and restore peace to the town, but he fears the consequences of defying his master.

**Personality:**  
Viktor is stern, cautious, and deeply conflicted. His public persona is that of a firm and unwavering leader, but in private, he is tormented by guilt and fear. He struggles with the moral compromises he has made to keep the town safe—or at least, to keep Sergei’s wrath at bay. Viktor’s cautious nature makes him distrustful of strangers, but he is not beyond hope if someone can convince him that redemption is possible.

**Habits:**  
Viktor spends much of his time overseeing the town’s affairs, often seen walking the streets with a watchful eye. He avoids speaking about the castle or Sergei unless absolutely necessary and is known to retreat to his private study in the town hall when troubled. He is meticulous in his duties but also takes nightly walks to the edge of the forest, where he contemplates the choices he has made.

### Detailed Interactions with Viktor Orlov

#### Interaction 1: Gain Viktor’s Trust

**Request:**  
To gain Viktor’s trust, the adventurers must prove they are genuinely concerned for the town and not simply seeking personal gain. Viktor is deeply suspicious of outsiders, but there are specific tasks that, if completed, would earn his confidence.

**Tasks:**
1. **Assist the Villagers:** Help repair the village’s defences or assist in a communal task, such as rebuilding the old windmill or reinforcing the town’s perimeter. This shows a commitment to the community’s well-being.
   - **Boon:** Viktor sees the adventurers as genuine allies and begins to trust them with more sensitive information.
   - **Bane:** Failing to complete the task or appearing disinterested leads Viktor to believe the adventurers are untrustworthy, making him even more guarded.

2. **Protect the Innocent:** Successfully defend the village from an attack by Sergei’s minions or other supernatural threats, demonstrating courage and a willingness to protect the townsfolk.
   - **Boon:** Viktor is impressed by the adventurers’ bravery and considers them potential saviours of the town.
   - **Bane:** If the adventurers fail to protect the village or show cowardice, Viktor becomes more withdrawn and refuses to offer any assistance.

3. **Uncover a Spy:** Identify and expose one of Sergei’s spies within the village, proving to Viktor that the adventurers are capable of seeing through deception and rooting out corruption.
   - **Boon:** Viktor feels a renewed sense of hope and begins to confide in the adventurers, seeing them as a means to undermine Sergei’s control.
   - **Bane:** If the adventurers are tricked by the spy or fail to act discreetly, Viktor loses faith in their abilities and may even fear they are in league with Sergei.

#### Interaction 2: Extract Information Under Duress

**Request:**  
If the adventurers choose a more forceful approach, they can attempt to extract information from Viktor by playing on his fears and weaknesses.

**What Viktor is Afraid Of:**
1. **Sergei’s Wrath:** Viktor fears Sergei more than anything else. Threatening to expose Viktor’s disloyalty to Sergei would terrify him and potentially force him to talk.
   - **Boon:** Viktor, terrified of Sergei’s retribution, divulges critical information about the castle’s layout, secret passages, or Sergei’s weaknesses.
   - **Bane:** Viktor, in a panic, might mislead the adventurers or offer false information in a desperate attempt to protect himself.

2. **Haunting Guilt:** Viktor is haunted by the guilt of the people who have suffered under his watch. The adventurers can exploit this by confronting him with the consequences of his actions, forcing him to acknowledge the harm he’s allowed to occur.
   - **Boon:** Overcome by guilt, Viktor reveals key details about the curse on the town and how it might be broken.
   - **Bane:** Pushing Viktor too hard could lead to a breakdown, rendering him unable to provide coherent information.

3. **Family Threats:** Viktor has a sister who lives in a nearby village. Subtly implying that Sergei’s enemies might target her could pressure Viktor into revealing what he knows.
   - **Boon:** Viktor, desperate to protect his sister, gives up everything he knows about Sergei’s plans and the Frozen Bride.
   - **Bane:** If Viktor suspects the adventurers might actually harm his sister, he could react violently or attempt to mislead them into a trap.

#### Interaction 3: Offer Redemption

**Request:**  
The adventurers can appeal to Viktor’s conscience and offer him a chance at redemption. This requires careful negotiation, as Viktor’s fear of Sergei is immense.

**What Arguments Would Work on Him:**
1. **Saving the Town:** Convince Viktor that by helping the adventurers, he can save the town and break the curse that has plagued it for so long. Emphasise that his actions could lead to the town’s rebirth and the restoration of his honour.
   - **Boon:** Inspired by the possibility of redemption, Viktor provides detailed information on how to access the hidden chamber beneath the castle where Yelena lies.
   - **Bane:** If Viktor feels the adventurers’ promises are empty or unrealistic, he may lose all hope and retreat further into compliance with Sergei.

2. **Honouring His Family:** Appeal to Viktor’s sense of legacy, reminding him that his family name will be remembered either as heroes who stood against evil or as cowards who succumbed to it. By helping, he can ensure his family’s name is honoured.
   - **Boon:** Viktor, moved by the idea of restoring his family’s honour, agrees to assist the adventurers, providing them with a map of the castle and warning them of Sergei’s traps.
   - **Bane:** If the adventurers seem insincere or manipulative, Viktor may become suspicious and refuse to cooperate.

3. **Exposing Sergei’s True Nature:** Reveal to Viktor that Sergei’s power is not as absolute as he believes, and that the vampire lord’s obsession with the Frozen Bride is a sign of weakness. Persuade Viktor that Sergei can be defeated, and that by helping, he will be freeing himself and the town from a tyrant.
   - **Boon:** Viktor, realising that Sergei’s hold on him is not unbreakable, provides crucial intelligence on Sergei’s vulnerabilities, including his dependence on the Frozen Bride’s presence.
   - **Bane:** If Viktor doubts the adventurers’ ability to defeat Sergei, he might choose to remain loyal to the vampire, fearing that rebellion will only lead to more suffering.
