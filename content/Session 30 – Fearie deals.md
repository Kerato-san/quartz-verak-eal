*32 Sirorev 1524*

In the enemy camp, the group observes a similar composition to the adversaries they had encountered earlier, with the exception of one individual. This figure, clad in ornate robes, exudes an air of authority, evidently the leader of this faction. The group watches as a team of guards moves towards where Suhana had fallen. They quickly bind her and drag her away, disappearing behind some tents.

The leader, sensing the proximity of the rest of the group, issues a command. His words carry a dark power, as he blesses his subordinates, their weapons becoming engulfed in black flames, a sinister and ominous sight.

Once again, the group finds themselves challenged by the enemy's hexes and curses, as well as the shrouding darkness that conceals the assassins. The battle is grueling, but as it nears its conclusion, the robed leader seizes Suhana as a hostage and attempts to make a strategic retreat.

In a crucial moment, Lugh, conserving his strength for such an opportunity, casts Hold Person on the enemy leader, effectively halting his escape. The group quickly encircles the immobilized foe, retrieving Suhana’s bag from his grasp. Aina then steps forward, disarming the leader before delivering a final, decisive blow, ensuring the end of the threat he posed.

Aina engages Suhana in a conversation, gradually coaxing her into revealing more about her affiliations and intentions. Suhana divulges that her patron is named Luvian, a name that resonates with Fey origins and evokes memories for Lugh of a Lord Luvian associated with the Winter Court.

Suhana recounts how she became aware of Ravi Singh's pursuit of the artifact and reported it to Luvian, who then instructed her to secure it for himself. This revelation sheds new light on Suhana's actions and her sudden departure during the earlier battle.

Meanwhile, Megan and Lugh take the opportunity to search the enemy camp, gathering resources and preparing for an overnight stay. Their search yields a lead box, a substantial amount of money, various scrolls and potions, and a note hinting at a grander, more ominous plot. The note makes reference to a “grand design,” “dominion,” and events on a “cosmic scale,” suggesting that their foes are part of an organization known as the “Exalted Assembly.”

As they settle in and begin preparing supper, Lugh senses a familiar Fey influence. The wind whispers secrets, the foliage exudes the scent of ancient earth, and wildflowers begin to sprout throughout the camp. This natural enchantment heralds the arrival of a graceful, androgynous elf whose aura is both alluring and enigmatic, his voice reminiscent of ancient rivers.

Lugh, feeling an intrusion, attempts to reject the elf's presence on the grounds of property invasion, but the effort is futile as they are not in their own demesne. The group treads cautiously, wary of causing offense. However, the elf, displeased with Suhana’s failure, punishes her with a mysterious pulse to her abdomen, extracting something from her. He then commands her to ensure the safety of the artifact, even if it means entrusting it to mortal hands.
